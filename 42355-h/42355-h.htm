COMMISSIONER AND MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY TO<br />
THE COURT OF FRANCE, AND COMMISSIONER<br />
FOR NEGOTIATING A PEACE
</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">&nbsp;</a></span>At the beginning of the Revolution, <span class="smcap">Dr Franklin</span>
was in England, where he had resided several years as
an agent for Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey and
Georgia. He returned to America in the spring of 1775,
and was shortly after elected a member of Congress. In
that body he held the rank, to which his great talents
and patriotism entitled him, and was chosen one of the Committee
of Secret Correspondence for transacting foreign affairs.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September, 1776, he was elected a
Commissioner to the Court of France, in conjunction with
Silas Deane and Thomas Jefferson. Immediately after
his appointment he hastened preparations for his departure.
Meantime Mr Jefferson declined serving, and Arthur
Lee was chosen in his place. Dr Franklin set off
from Philadelphia on his voyage, October 26th, and entered
Quiberon Bay, on the coast of France, November
29th, after a fatiguing passage. He was now seventyone
years of age. He proceeded to Nantes, where he remained
a few days to recruit himself, and arrived in Paris
about the 20th of December. Here he found Mr Deane,
and they were soon after joined by Mr Lee.</p>

<p>Little was done by the Commissioners in Paris
for more than a year, as France was not then prepared to take an
open part against England. The success of the American
arms against Burgoyne became the turning point in the
French Cabinet, and they immediately consented to make
treaties of amity and commerce with the United States,
which were definitively signed on the 6th of February,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
1778. This great work being finished, Congress deemed
it expedient to dissolve the Commission by appointing a
Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of France. The
choice fell on Dr Franklin, and, notwithstanding his advanced
age, and the arduous nature of the office, he accepted
the appointment, and discharged the entire duties of it to
the end of the Revolution.</p>

<p>While holding the place of joint Commissioner in
France, Congress elected him, on the 1st of January,
1777, to a separate mission to the Court of Spain.
Upon this mission, however, he never entered, and it was
afterwards transferred to Arthur Lee.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the war, Dr Franklin strenuously
urged Congress to permit him to return to his own
country, requesting that a successor might be sent out,
whose years and strength would better qualify him to
endure the labors and perform the services of his station.
But Congress did not listen to this petition. His counsels
and experience were thought essential to the management
of the important concerns then pending. He
took a leading part in all the negotiations for peace, and,
in conjunction with John Adams, John Jay, and Henry
Laurens, signed the preliminary articles, November 30th,
1782, and the definitive treaty, September 3d, 1783.
On the 3d of April, of the same year, he concluded a
treaty of amity and commerce, with the Swedish Minister
in Paris, between Sweden and the United States.</p>

<p>Mr Jefferson at length arrived in Paris as his successor,
and Dr Franklin returned to Philadelphia in September,
1785, after an absence of nine years, during the
whole of which time he had been engaged in a most
active, laborious, and successful service for his country.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Nantes, December 8th, 1776.</p>
<p class="open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>In thirty days after we left the Capes of Delaware, we
came to an anchor in Quiberon Bay. I remained on board
four days, expecting a change of wind proper to carry the
ship into the river Loire; but the wind seemed fixed in an
opposite quarter. I landed at Aury, and with some difficulty
got hither, the road not being well supplied with
means of conveyance. Two days before we saw land, we
met a brigantine from Bordeaux belonging to Cork, and
another from Rochefort belonging to Hull, both of which
were taken. The first had on board staves, tar, turpentine,
and claret; the other coniac brandy and flaxseed.
There is some difficulty in determining what to do with
them, as they are scarce worth sending to America, and
the mind of the French Court, with regard to prizes
brought into their ports, is not yet known. It is certainly
contrary to their treaties with Britain, to permit the sale of
them, and we have no regular means of trying and condemning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
them. There are, however, many here, who
would purchase prizes, we having already had several
offers from persons who are willing to take upon themselves
all consequences as to the illegality. Captain Wickes, as
soon as he can get his refreshment, intends to cruise in the
channel.</p>

<p>Our friends in France have been a good deal dejected
with the Gazette accounts of advantages obtained against
us by the British troops. I have helped them here to
recover their spirits a little, by assuring them that we still
face the enemy, and were under no apprehension of their
armies being able to complete their junction. I understand
that Mr Lee has lately been at Paris, that Mr Deane is
still there, and that an underhand supply is obtained from
the government of two hundred brass field pieces, thirty
thousand firelocks, and some other military stores, which
are now shipping for America, and will be convoyed by a
ship of war. The Court of England (Mr Penet tells me,
from whom I have the above intelligence) had the folly to
demand Mr Deane to be delivered up, but were refused.</p>

<p>Our voyage, though not long, was rough, and I feel myself
weakened by it, but I now recover strength daily, and
in a few days shall be able to undertake the journey to
Paris. I have not yet taken any public character, thinking
it prudent first to know whether the Court is ready and
willing to receive Ministers publicly from the Congress,
that we may neither embarrass her on the one hand, nor
subject ourselves to the hazard of a disgraceful refusal on
the other. I have despatched an express to Mr Deane,
with the letters that I had for him from the Committee,
and a copy of our commission, that he may immediately
make the proper inquiries, and give me information. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the mean time I find it generally supposed here, that I am
sent to negotiate, and that opinion appears to give great
pleasure, if I can judge by the extreme civilities I meet
with from numbers of the principal people, who have done
me the honor to visit me.</p>

<p>I have desired Mr Deane, by some speedy and safe
means, to give Mr Lee notice of his appointment. I find
several vessels here laden with military stores for America,
just ready to sail; on the whole, there is the greatest prospect
that we shall be well provided for another campaign,
and much stronger than we were last. A Spanish fleet has
sailed with seven thousand land forces foot and some
horse. Their destination unknown, but supposed against
the Portuguese in Brazil. Both France and England are
preparing strong fleets, and it is said, that all the powers of
Europe are preparing for war, apprehending that a general
one cannot be very far distant. When I arrive at Paris I
shall be able to write with more certainty. I beg you to
present my duty to Congress, and assure them of my most
faithful endeavors in their service.</p>

<p>With the sincerest esteem and respect, I have the honor
to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE COMMITTEE OF SECRET CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Nantes, December 8th, 1776.</p>

<p class="open">Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>After a short but rough passage of thirty days, we anchored
in Quiberon Bay, the wind not suiting to enter the
Loire. Captain Wickes did everything in his power to
make the voyage comfortable to me; and I was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pleased with what I saw of his conduct as an officer, when
on supposed occasions we made preparation for engagement,
the good order and readiness with which it was
done, being far beyond my expectations, and I believe
equal to anything of the kind in the best ships of the king's
fleet. He seems to have also a very good set of officers
under him. I hope they will all in good time be promoted.
He met and took two prizes, brigantines, one belonging to
Cork, laden with staves, pitch, tar, turpentine, and claret;
the other to Hull, with a cargo of flaxseed and brandy.
The captains have made some propositions of ransom,
which, perhaps, may be accepted, as there is yet no means
of condemning them here, and they are scarce worth sending
to America. The ship is yet in Quiberon Bay, with her
prizes. I came hither from thence, seventy miles, by land.
I am made extremely welcome here, where America has
many friends. As soon as I have recovered strength
enough for the journey, which I hope will be in a very
few days, I shall set out for Paris. My letter to the President
will inform you of some other particulars.</p>

<p>With great esteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

</p>

<p><em>P. S. December 10th.</em> I have just learnt that eighty
pieces of cannon, all brass, with carriages, braces,
and everything fit for immediate service, were embarked in a
frigate from Havre, which is sailed; the rest were to go in
another frigate of thirtysix guns.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, January 4th, 1777.</p>

<p class="open">Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>I arrived here about two weeks since, where I found
Mr Deane. Mr Lee has since joined us from London.
We have had an audience of the Minister, Count de Vergennes,
and were respectfully received. We left for his
consideration a sketch of the proposed treaty.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to wait upon him tomorrow with a strong memorial, requesting
the aids mentioned in our instructions. By his
advice, we have had an interview with the Spanish Ambassador,
Count d'Aranda, who seems well disposed
towards us, and will forward copies of our memorials to
his Court, which will act, he says, in perfect concert with
this.</p>

<p>Their fleets are said to be in fine order, manned and
fit for sea. The cry of this nation is for us, but the
Court, it is thought, views an approaching war with reluctance.
The press continues in England. As soon as we
can receive a positive answer from these Courts, we shall
despatch an express with it.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The bearer, Captain Balm, is strongly recommended
to me as a very able officer of horse, and capable of
being extremely useful to us, in forming a body of men for
that service. As he has otherwise an excellent character,
I take the liberty of recommending him to my friends as
a stranger of merit, worthy of their civilities, and to the

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I left in your Excellency's hands, to be communicated,
if you please, to your Court, a duplicate of the commission
from Congress, appointing me to go to Spain as their Minister
Plenipotentiary. But, as I understand, that the receiving
such a Minister is not at present thought convenient,
and I am sure the Congress would have nothing done
that might incommode in the least a Court they so much
respect, I shall therefore postpone that journey till circumstances
may make it more suitable. In the mean time,
I beg leave to lay before his Catholic Majesty, through the
hands of your Excellency, the propositions contained in a
resolution of Congress, dated December 30th, 1776, viz.</p>

<p>"That if His Catholic Majesty will join with the United
States in a war against Great Britain, they will assist in reducing
to the possession of Spain the town and harbor of
Pensacola; provided the inhabitants of the United States
shall have the free navigation of the Mississippi, and the use
of the harbor of Pensacola; and will, (provided it shall be
true, that his Portuguese Majesty has insultingly expelled
the vessels of these States from his ports, or has confiscated
any such vessels,) declare war against the said King,
if that measure shall be agreeable to, and supported by,
the Courts of France and Spain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>It is understood, that the strictest union subsists between
those two Courts; and in case Spain and France should
think fit to attempt the conquest of the English sugar
islands, Congress have further proposed to furnish provisions
to the amount of two millions of dollars, and to join
the fleet employed on the occasion, with six frigates of not
less than twentyfour guns each, manned and fitted for service;
and to render any other assistance which may be
in their power, as becomes good allies; without desiring
for themselves the possession of any of the said islands.</p>

<p>These propositions are subject to discussion, and to
receive such modification as may be found proper.</p>

<p>With great respect, I have the honor to be your Excellency's
most obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO GENERAL WASHINGTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 13th, 1777.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The bearer, M. le Comte Kotkouski, a Polish officer, is
recommended to me by several persons of worth here,
as a man of experience in military affairs, and of tried
bravery. He has lost his family and estate in Poland, by
fighting there in the cause of liberty, and wishes, by engaging
in the same cause, to find a new country and new
friends in America. Count Pulaski, who was a General
of the confederates in Poland, and who is gone to join
you, is esteemed one of the greatest officers in Europe.
He can give you the character of this M. Kotkouski, who
served under him as Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

<p>It is with regret that I give letters of introduction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
foreign officers, fearing that you may be troubled with
more than you can provide for, or employ to their and
your own satisfaction. When particular cases seem to
have a claim to such letters, I hope you will excuse my
taking the liberty. I give no expectations to those who
apply for them; I promise nothing, I acquaint them that
their being placed when they arrive is a great uncertainty,
and that the voyage being long, expensive, and hazardous,
I counsel them not to undertake it. This honest gentleman's
zeal is not to be discouraged by such means; he
determines to go and serve as a volunteer, if he cannot be
employed immediately as an officer; but I wish and hope
that your Excellency may find a better situation for him,
and that he will be a useful officer. He has the advantage
of understanding English, and will soon speak it
intelligibly. He also speaks German, and some other
European languages, and the Latin.</p>

<p>With the truest esteem and respect, I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

well recommended to me as an officer of experience and
merit, with a request that I would give him a letter of
introduction. I have acquainted him, that you are rather
overstocked with officers, and that his obtaining employment
in your army is an uncertainty; but his zeal for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
American cause is too great for any discouragements I

<h3>REMARKS ON A LOAN FOR THE UNITED STATES.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h3>

<p>In borrowing money, a man's credit depends on some,
or all, of the following particulars.</p>

<p>First, His known conduct respecting former loans, and
his punctuality in discharging them.</p>

<p>Secondly, His industry.</p>

<p>Thirdly, His frugality.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The amount and the certainty of his income,
and the freedom of his estate from the incumbrances of
prior debts.</p>

<p>Fifthly, His well founded prospects of greater future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ability, by the improvement of his estate in value, and by
aids from others.</p>

<p>Sixthly, His known prudence in managing his general
affairs, and the advantage they will probably receive from
the loan which he desires.</p>

<p>Seventhly, His known probity and honest character,
manifested by his voluntary discharge of debts, which he
could not have been legally compelled to pay. The circumstances,
which give credit to an <em>individual</em>, ought
to have, and will have, their weight upon the lenders of
money to <em>public bodies</em> or nations. If then we consider
and compare Britain and America in these several particulars,
upon the question, "To which is it safest to lend
money?" We shall find,</p>

<p>1. Respecting <em>former loans</em>, that America, who borrowed
ten millions during the last war, for the maintenance
of her army of 25,000 men and other charges, had faithfully
discharged and paid that debt, and all her other debts,
in 1772. Whereas Britain, during those ten years of peace
and profitable commerce, had made little or no reduction
of her debt; but on the contrary, from time to time,
diminished the hopes of her creditors, by a wanton diversion
and misapplication of the sinking fund destined for
discharging it.</p>

<p>2. Respecting <em>industry</em>; every man in America is
employed; the greater part in cultivating their own lands,
the rest in handicrafts, navigation, and commerce. An
idle man there is a rarity; idleness and inutility are disgraceful.
In England the number of that character is immense,
fashion has spread it far and wide; hence the
embarrassments of private fortunes, and the daily bankruptcies
arising from a universal fondness for appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and expensive pleasures, and hence, in some degree, the
mismanagement of public business; for habits of business,
and ability in it, are acquired only by practice; and where
universal dissipation, and the perpetual pursuit of amusement
are the mode, the youth educated in it can rarely
afterwards acquire that patient attention and close application
to affairs, which are so necessary to a statesman
charged with the care of national welfare. <em>Hence</em> their
frequent errors in policy, and hence the weariness at public
councils, and backwardness in going to them, the constant
unwillingness to engage in any measure that requires
thought and consideration, and the readiness for postponing
every new proposition; which postponing is therefore the
only part of business they come to be expert in, an expertness
produced necessarily by so much daily practice.
Whereas in America, men bred to close employment in
their private affairs attend with ease to those of the public
when engaged in them, and nothing fails through negligence.</p>

<p>3. Respecting <em>frugality</em>; the manner of living in
America is more simple and less expensive than in England,
plain tables, plain clothing, and plain furniture in
houses prevail, with few carriages of pleasure, there an
expensive appearance hurts credit and is avoided, in
England it is often assumed to gain credit, and continued
to ruin. Respecting <em>public</em> affairs, the difference is still
greater. In England the salaries of officers and emoluments
of office are enormous. The king has a million
sterling per annum, and yet cannot maintain his family free
of debt, secretaries of state, lords of treasury, admiralty,
&amp;c. have vast appointments, an auditor of the exchequer
has sixpence in the pound, or a fortieth part of all the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
money expended by the nation; so that when a war
costs forty millions, one million is paid to him; an inspector
of the mint, in the last new coinage, received as his fee
£65,000 sterling per annum; to all which rewards no
service these gentlemen can render the public is by any
means equivalent. All this is paid by the people, who
are oppressed by taxes so occasioned, and thereby rendered
less able to contribute to the payment of necessary
national debts. In America, salaries, where indispensable,
are extremely low; but much of the public business is
done gratis. The honor of serving the public ably and
faithfully is deemed sufficient. <em>Public spirit</em> really exists
there, and has great effects. In England it is universally
deemed a nonentity, and whoever pretends to it is laughed
at as a fool, or suspected as a knave. The committees of
Congress which form the board of war, the board of treasury,
the board of foreign affairs, the naval board, that
for accounts, &amp;c. all attend the business of their respective
functions without any salary or emolument whatever,
though they spend in it much more of their time, than any
lord of the treasury or admiralty in England can spare
from his amusements. A British Minister lately computed,
that the whole expense of the Americans in their
<em>civil</em> government, over three millions of people, amounted
to but £70,000 sterling, and drew from thence a conclusion,
that they ought to be taxed, until their expense was
equal in proportion to that which it costs Great Britain to
govern eight millions. He had no idea of a contrary
conclusion, that if three millions may be well governed for
£70,000, eight millions may be as well governed for three
times that sum, and that therefore the expense of his own
government should be diminished. In that corrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nation, no man is ashamed of being concerned in lucrative
<em>government jobs</em>, in which the public money is egregiously
misapplied and squandered, the treasury pillaged, and
more numerous and heavy taxes accumulated, to the great
oppression of the people. But the prospect of a greater
number of such jobs by a war is an inducement with
many to cry out for war upon all occasions, and to oppose
every proposition of peace. Hence the constant increase
of the national debt, and the absolute improbability of its
ever being discharged.</p>

<p>4. Respecting the <em>amount and certainty of income,
and solidity of security</em>, the <em>whole</em> thirteen States of
America are engaged for the payment of every debt contracted
by the Congress, and the debt to be contracted by
the present war is the <em>only</em> debt they will have to pay; all,
or nearly all, the former debts of particular Colonies being
already discharged. Whereas England will have to pay
not only the enormous debt this war must occasion, but all
their vast preceding debt, or the interest of it,&mdash;and while
America is enriching itself by prizes made upon the British
commerce, more than ever it did by any commerce of
its own under the restraints of a British monopoly and the
diminution of its revenues and of course, less able to discharge
the present indiscreet increase of its expenses.</p>

<p>5. Respecting prospect of greater <em>future ability</em>, Britain
has none such. Her islands are circumscribed by the
ocean, and excepting a few parks or forests, she has no
new land to cultivate, and cannot therefore extend her improvements.
Her numbers, too, instead of increasing from
increased subsistence, are continually diminishing from
growing luxury, and the increasing difficulties of maintaining
families, which of course discourage early marriages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Thus she will have fewer people to assist in paying her
debts, and that diminishing number will be poorer.
America, on the contrary, has, besides her lands already
cultivated, a vast territory yet to be cultivated; which,
being cultivated, continually increases in value with the
increase of people; and the people, who double themselves
by a <em>natural propagation</em> every twentyfive years,
will double yet faster by the accession of <em>strangers</em>, as
long as lands are to be had for new families; so that
every twenty years there will be a double number of
inhabitants obliged to discharge the public debts; and
those inhabitants being more opulent may pay their
shares with greater ease.</p>

<p>6. Respecting <em>prudence</em> in general affairs, and the
advantages to be expected from the loan desired; the
Americans are cultivators of land; those engaged in
fishery and commerce are few, compared with the others.
They have ever conducted their several governments with
wisdom, avoiding wars and vain expensive projects, delighting
only in their peaceable occupations, which must,
considering the extent of their uncultivated territory, find
them employment still for ages. Whereas England, ever
unquiet, ambitious, avaricious, imprudent, and quarrelsome,
is half of the time engaged in war, always at an
expense infinitely greater than the advantages to be obtained
by it, if successful. Thus they made war against
Spain in 1739, for a claim of about £95,000, (scarce a
groat for each individual of the nation) and spent forty millions
sterling in the war, and the lives of fifty thousand
men; and finally made peace without obtaining satisfaction
for the sum claimed. Indeed, there is scarce a
nation in Europe, against which she has not made war on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
some frivolous pretext or other, and thereby imprudently
accumulated a debt, that has brought her on the verge of
bankruptcy. But the most indiscreet of all her wars is
the present against America, with whom she might for
ages have preserved her profitable connexion only by a
just and equitable conduct. She is now acting like a mad
shop keeper, who, by beating those that pass his doors,
attempts to make them come in and be his customers.
America cannot submit to such treatment, without being
first ruined, and, being ruined, her custom will be worth
nothing. England, to effect this, is increasing her debt,
and irretrievably ruining herself. America, on the other
hand, aims only to establish her liberty, and that freedom
of commerce which will be advantageous to all Europe;
and by abolishing that monopoly which she labored
under, she will profit infinitely more than enough to repay
any debt, which she may contract to accomplish it.</p>

<p>7. Respecting <em>character in the honest payment of debts</em>;
the punctuality with which America has discharged her
public debts was shown under the first head. And the
general good disposition of the people to such punctuality
has been manifested in their faithful payment of <em>private</em>
debts to England, since the commencement of this war.
There were not wanting some politicians (in America)
who proposed <em>stopping that payment</em>, until peace should
be restored, alleging, that in the usual course of commerce,
and of the credit given, there was always a debt existing
equal to the trade of eighteen months; that the trade
amounting to five millions sterling per annum, the debt
must be seven millions and a half; that this sum paid to
the British merchants would operate to prevent that distress,
intended to be brought upon Britain, by our stoppage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of commerce with her; for the merchants receiving this
money, and no orders with it for further supplies, would
either lay it out in public funds, or in employing manufactures
to accumulate goods for a future hungry market in
America upon an expected accommodation, by which
means the funds would be kept up and the manufacturers
prevented from murmuring. But <em>against this it was alleged</em>,
that injuries from ministers should not be revenged
on merchants; that the credit was in consequence of private
contracts made in confidence of good faith; that
these ought to be held sacred and faithfully complied with;
for that, whatever public utility might be supposed to arise
from a breach of private faith, it was unjust, and would in
the end be found unwise, honesty being in truth the best
policy. On this principle the proposition was universally
rejected; and though the English prosecuted the war with
unexampled barbarity, burning our defenceless towns in
the midst of winter, and arming savages against us; the
debt was punctually paid, and the merchants of London
have testified to the Parliament, and will testify to all the
world, that from their experience in dealing with us they
had, before the war, no apprehension of our unfairness,
and that since the war they have been convinced that their
good opinion of us was well founded. England, on the
contrary, an old, corrupt government, extravagant and
profligate nation, sees herself deep in debt, which she is in
no condition to pay, and yet is madly and dishonestly running
deeper, without any possibility of discharging her debt
but by a public bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, from the general industry, frugality,
ability, prudence, and virtue of America, that she is a
much safer debtor than Britain; to say nothing of the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
generous minds must have in reflecting, that by
loans to America they are opposing tyranny, and aiding the
cause of liberty, which is the cause of all mankind.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, October 14th, 1777.</p>
<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received duly your letter of May 2d, 1777, including
a copy of one you had sent me the year before, which
never came to hand, and which it seems has been the case
with some I wrote to you from America. Filled, though
our letters have always been, with sentiments of good will
to both countries, and earnest desires of preventing their
ruin and promoting their mutual felicity, I have been apprehensive
that if it were known that a correspondence subsisted
between us, it might be attended with inconvenience
to you. I have therefore been backward in writing, not
caring to trust the post, and not well knowing who else to
trust with my letters. But being now assured of a safe
conveyance, I venture to write to you, especially as I think
the subject such a one as you may receive a letter upon
without censure.</p>

<p>Happy should I have been, if the honest warnings I
gave, of the fatal separation of interests as well as of affections,
that must attend the measures commenced while I
was in England, had been attended to, and the horrid mischief
of this abominable war been thereby prevented. I
should still be happy in any successful endeavors for restoring
peace, consistent with the liberties, the safety, and the
honor of America. As to our submitting to the government
of Great Britain, it is vain to think of it. She has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
given us, by her numberless barbarities, (by her malice in
bribing slaves to murder their masters, and savages to massacre
the families of farmers, with her baseness in rewarding
the unfaithfulness of servants, and debauching the virtue
of honest seamen, intrusted with our property) in the prosecution
of the war, and in the treatment of the prisoners,
so deep an impression of her depravity, that we never
again can trust her in the management of our affairs and
interests. It is now impossible to persuade our people, as I
long endeavored, that the war was merely ministerial, and
that the nation bore still a good will to us. The infinite
number of addresses printed in your gazettes, all approving
the conduct of your government towards us, and encouraging
our destruction by every possible means, the great majority
in Parliament constantly manifesting the same sentiments,
and the popular public rejoicings on occasion of any
news of the slaughter of an innocent and virtuous people,
fighting only in defence of their just rights; these, together
with the recommendations of the same measures by even
your celebrated moralists and divines, in their writings and
sermons, that are still approved and applauded in your
great national assemblies, all join in convincing us, that you
are no longer the magnanimous enlightened nation we once
esteemed you, and that you are unfit and unworthy to govern
us, as not being able to govern your own passions.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, I should be nevertheless happy in
seeing peace restored. For though if my friends and the
friends of liberty and virtue, who still remain in England,
could be drawn out of it, a continuance of this war to the
ruin of the rest would give me less concern. I cannot, as
that removal is impossible, but wish for peace for their
sakes, as well as for the sake of humanity, and preventing
further carnage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>This wish of mine, ineffective as it may be, induces
me to mention to you, that between nations long exasperated
against each other in war, some act of generosity
and kindness towards prisoners on one side has softened
resentment, and abated animosity on the other, so as to
bring on an accommodation. You in England, if you wish
for peace, have at present the opportunity of trying this
means with regard to the prisoners now in your gaols.
They complain of very severe treatment. They are far
from their friends and families, and winter is coming on,
in which they must suffer extremely, if continued in their
present situation; fed scantily on bad provisions, without
warm lodging, clothes, or fire, and not suffered to invite or
receive visits from their friends, or even from the humane
and charitable of their enemies.</p>

<p>I can assure you, from my own certain knowledge, that
your people, prisoners in America, have been treated with
great kindness; they have been served with the same rations
of wholesome provisions with our own troops, comfortable
lodgings have been provided for them, and they
have been allowed large bounds of villages in the healthy
air, to walk and amuse themselves with on their parole.
Where you have thought fit to employ contractors to supply
your people, these contractors have been protected and
aided in their operations. Some considerable act of kindness
towards our people would take off the reproach of inhumanity
in that respect from the nation, and leave it
where it ought with more certainty to lay on the conductors
of your war in America. This I hint to you, out of
some remaining good will to a nation I once loved sincerely.
But as things are, and in my present temper of
mind, not being over fond of receiving obligations, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
content myself with proposing, that your government would
allow us to send or employ a commissary to take some
care of those unfortunate people. Perhaps on your representations
this might speedily be obtained in England,
though it was refused most inhumanly at New York.</p>

<p>If you could have leisure to visit the gaols in which
they are confined, and should be desirous of knowing the
truth relative to the treatment they receive, I wish you
would take the trouble of distributing among the most
necessitous according to their wants, five or six hundred
pounds, for which your drafts on me here shall be punctually
honored. You could then be able to speak with
some certainty to the point in Parliament, and this might
be attended with good effects.</p>

<p>If you cannot obtain for us permission to send a commissary,
possibly you may find a trusty, humane, discreet person
at Plymouth, and another at Portsmouth, who would
undertake to communicate what relief we may be able to
afford those unfortunate men, martyrs to the cause of liberty.
Your king will not reward you for taking this trouble,
but God will. I shall not mention the gratitude of
America; you will have what is better, the applause of
your own good conscience. Our captains have set at liberty
above two hundred of your people, made prisoners by
our armed vessels and brought into France, besides a great
number dismissed at sea on your coasts, to whom vessels
were given to carry them in. But you have not returned
us a man in exchange. If we had sold your people to the
Moors at Sallee, as you have many of ours to the African
and East India Companies, could you have complained?</p>

<p>In revising what I have written, I found too much
warmth in it, and was about to strike out some parts. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
I let them go, as they will afford you this one reflection;
"If a man naturally cool, and rendered still cooler by old
age, is so warmed by our treatment of his country, how
much must those people in general be exasperated against
us? And why are we making inveterate enemies by our
barbarity, not only of the present inhabitants of a great
country, but of their infinitely more numerous posterity;
who will in future ages detest the name of <em>Englishman</em>, as
much as the children in Holland now do those of <em>Alva</em> and
<em>Spaniard</em>." This will certainly happen, unless your conduct
is speedily changed, and the national resentment falls,
where it ought to fall heavily, on your ministry, or perhaps
rather on the king, whose will they only execute.</p>

<p>With the greatest esteem and affection, and best wishes
for your prosperity, I have the honor to be, dear sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, December 21st, 1777.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I see in a vote of Congress, shown me by Captain
Franval, that Mr Deane is disowned in some of his agreements
with officers. I, who am upon the spot, and know
the infinite difficulty of resisting the powerful solicitations of
great men, who if disobliged might have it in their power to
obstruct the supplies he was then obtaining, do not wonder,
that being then a stranger to the people, and unacquainted
with the language, he was at first prevailed on to make
some such agreements, when all were recommended, as
they always are, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">officiers expérimentés, braves comme leurs
epeés, pleins de courage, des talents, et de zèle, pour notre</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<em>cause</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c. in short mere Cesars, each of whom would
have been an invaluable acquisition to America. You can
have no conception how we are still besieged, and worried
on this head, our time cut to pieces by personal applications,
besides those contained in dozens of letters by every
post, which are so generally refused, that scarce one in a
hundred obtains from us a simple recommendation to
civilities.</p>

<p>I hope, therefore, that favorable allowance will be made
to my worthy colleague, on account of his situation at the
time, as he has long since corrected that mistake, and daily
approves himself to my certain knowledge an able, faithful,
active, and extremely useful servant of the public, a testimony
I think it my duty to take this occasion of giving to
his merit, unasked, as, considering my great age, I may
probably not live to give it personally in Congress, and I
perceive he has enemies.</p>

<p>You will see the general news in the papers in particular,
I can only say at present, that our affairs go well
here, and that</p>

<h3>TO JAMES HUTTON.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, February 1st, 1778.</p>

<p class="open">My dear old Friend,
</p>

<p>You desired, that if I had no proposition to make, I
would at least give my advice.</p>

<p>I think it is Ariosto who says, that all things lost on
earth, are to be found in the moon; on which somebody
remarked, that there must be a great deal of good advice
in the moon. If so there is a good deal of mine formerly
given and lost in this business. I will, however, at your
request give a little more, but without the least expectation,
that it will be followed; for none but God can at the
same time give good counsel, and wisdom to make use
of it.</p>

<p>You have lost by this mad war, and the barbarity with
which it has been carried on, not only the government and
commerce of America, and the public revenues and private
wealth arising from that commerce, but what is more, you
have lost the esteem, respect, friendship, and affection of
all that great and growing people, who consider you at
present, and whose posterity will consider you, as the worst
and wickedest nation upon earth. A peace you may undoubtedly
obtain, by dropping all your pretensions to
govern us; and by your superior skill in huckstering negotiation,
you may possibly make such an apparently advantageous
bargain, as shall be applauded in your Parliament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
but if you cannot, with the peace, recover the affections
of that people, it will not be a lasting nor a profitable one,
nor will it afford you any part of that strength, which
you once had by your union with them, and might (if
you had been wise enough to take advice) have still
retained.</p>

<p>To recover their respect and affection, you must tread
back the steps you have taken.</p>

<p>Instead of honoring and rewarding the American advisers
and promoters of this war, you should disgrace them;
with all those who have inflamed the nation against America
by their malicious writings; and all the ministers and generals
who have prosecuted the war with such inhumanity.
This would show a national change of disposition, and a
disapprobation of what had passed.</p>

<p>In proposing terms, you should not only grant such as
the necessity of your affairs may evidently oblige you to
grant, but such additional ones as may show your generosity,
and thereby demonstrate your good will. For
instance, perhaps you might, by your treaty, retain all
Canada, Nova Scotia, and the Floridas. But if you would
have a real friendly as well as able ally in America, and
avoid all occasion of future discord, which will otherwise
be continually arising on your American frontiers, you
should throw in those countries. And you may call it, if
you please, an indemnification for the burning of their
towns, which indemnification will otherwise be some time
or other demanded.</p>

<p>I know your people will not see the utility of such measures,
and will never follow them, and even call it insolence
and impudence in me to mention them. I have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
however, complied with your desire, and am, as ever, your
affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN.
</p>

<p><em>P. S. February 12th, 1778.</em> I wrote the above
some time before I received yours, acquainting me with
your speedy and safe return, which gave me pleasure. I
doubted after I had written it, whether it would be well to
send it; for as your proud nation despises us exceedingly,
and demands and expects absolute and humble submission,
all talk of treaty must appear imprudence, and tend to
provoke rather than conciliate. As you still press me by
your last to say something, I conclude to send what I had
written, for I think the advice is good, though it must be
useless; and I cannot, as some amongst you desire, make
propositions, having none committed to me to make; but
we can treat if any are made to us; which however we do
not expect. I abominate with you all murder, and I may
add, that the slaughter of men in an unjust cause is nothing
less than murder; I therefore never think of your present
ministers and their abettors, but with the image strongly
painted in my view, of their hands, red, wet, and dropping
with the blood of my countrymen, friends, and relations.
No peace can be signed by those hands.</p>

<p>Peace and friendship will, nevertheless, subsist for ever
between Mr Hutton and his affectionate friend,</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, February 12th, 1778.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>A thousand thanks for your so readily engaging in the
means of relieving our poor captives, and the pains you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
have taken, and the advances you have made for that purpose.
I received your kind letter of the 3d instant, and
send you enclosed a bill of one hundred pounds. I much
approve of Mr Wren's prudent, as well as benevolent conduct
in the disposition of the money, and wish him to continue
doing what shall appear to him and to you to be right,
which I am persuaded will appear the same to me and my
colleagues here. I beg you will present him, when you
write, my respectful acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Your "earnest caution and request, that nothing may
ever persuade America to throw themselves into the arms
of France, for that times may mend, and that an American
must always be a stranger in France, but that Great
Britain may for ages to come be their home," marks the
goodness of your heart, your regard for us, and love of
your country. But when your nation is hiring all the cut-throats
it can collect, of all countries and colors, to destroy
us, it is hard to persuade us not to ask or accept aid from
any power, that may be prevailed with to grant it; and
this only from the hope, that though you now thirst for our
blood, and pursue us with fire and sword, you may in some
future time treat us kindly. This is too much patience to
be expected of us; indeed I think it is not in human
nature.</p>

<p>The Americans are received and treated here in France
with a cordiality, a respect, and affection they never experienced
in England when they most deserved it; and
which is now (after all the pains taken to exasperate the
English against them, and render them odious as well as
contemptible) less to be expected there than ever. And I
cannot see why we may not, upon an alliance, hope for a
continuance of it, at least as much as the Swiss enjoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with whom France have maintained a faithful friendship for
two hundred years past, and whose people appear to live
here in as much esteem as the natives. America has been
<em>forced</em> and <em>driven</em> into the arms of France. She was a
dutiful and virtuous daughter. A cruel mother in law
turned her out of doors, defamed her, and sought her life.
All the world knows her innocence, and takes her part;
and her friends hope soon to see her honorably married.
They can never persuade her return and submission to so
barbarous an enemy. In her future prosperity, if she forgets
and forgives, it is all that can be reasonably expected of
her. I believe she will make as good and useful a wife as
she did a daughter, that her husband will love and honor
her, and that the family, from which she was so wickedly
expelled, will long regret the loss of her.</p>

<p>I know not whether a peace with us is desired in England;
I rather think it is not at present, unless on the old
impossible terms of submission and receiving pardon.
Whenever you shall be disposed to make peace upon equal
and reasonable terms, you will find little difficulty, if you
get first an honest Ministry. The present have all along
acted so deceitfully and treacherously, as well as inhumanly,
towards the Americans, that I imagine, that the absolute
want of all confidence in them will make a treaty, at
present, between them and the Congress impracticable.</p>

<p>The subscription for the prisoners will have excellent
effects in favor of England and Englishmen. The Scotch
subscriptions for raising troops to destroy us, though
amounting to much greater sums, will not do their nation
half so much good. If you have an opportunity, I wish
you would express our respectful acknowledgments and
thanks to your committee and contributors, whose benefactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
will make our poor people as comfortable as their
situation can permit. Adieu, my dear friend. Accept my
thanks for the excellent papers you enclosed to me. Your
endeavors for peace, though unsuccessful, will always be a
comfort to you, and in time, when this mad war shall be
universally execrated, will be a solid addition to your
reputation.</p>

<p>I am ever, with the highest esteem, &amp;c.</p>

</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> An old friend of mine, Mr Hutton, a chief of
the Moravians, who is often at the Queen's palace, and is
sometimes spoken to by the King, was over here lately.
He pretended to no commission, but urged me much to
propose some terms of peace, which I avoided. He has
written to me since his return, pressing the same thing, and

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, February 26th, 1778.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received yours of the 18th and 20th of this month,
with Lord North's proposed bills. The more I see of the
ideas and projects of your Ministry, and their little arts
and schemes of amusing and dividing us, the more I admire the
prudent, manly, and magnanimous propositions contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in your intended motion for an address to the King. What
reliance can we have on an act expressing itself to be only
a declaration of the <em>intention</em> of Parliament, concerning the
<em>exercise</em> of the right of imposing taxes in America, when in
the bill itself, as well as in the title, a right is supposed and
claimed, which never existed; and a <em>present intention</em> only
is declared not to use it, which may be changed by another
act next session, with a preamble, that this <em>intention</em> being
found expedient, it is thought proper to repeal this act, and
resume the exercise of <em>the right</em> in its full extent. If any
solid permanent benefit was intended by this, why is it
confined to the Colonies of North America, and not extended
to the loyal ones in the sugar islands? But it is
now endless to criticise, as all acts that suppose your
future government of the Colonies can be no longer
significant.</p>

<p>In the act for appointing Commissioners, instead of full
powers to agree upon terms of peace and friendship, with
a promise of ratifying such treaty as they shall make in
pursuance of those powers, it is declared, that their agreements
shall have no force nor effect, nor be carried into
execution till approved of by Parliament; so that every
thing of importance will be uncertain. But they are
allowed to proclaim a cessation of arms, and revoke their
proclamation, as soon as in consequence of it our militia
have been allowed to go home; they may suspend the
operation of acts, prohibiting trade, and take off that suspension
when our merchants, in consequence of it, have
been induced to send their ships to sea; in short, they may
do everything that can have a tendency to divide and distract
us, but nothing that can afford us security. Indeed,
Sir, your Ministers do not know us. We may not be quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
so cunning as they, but we have really more sense, as well
as more courage, than they have ever been willing to give
us credit for; and I am persuaded, these acts will rather
obstruct peace than promote it, and that they will not
answer in America the mischievous and malevolent ends
for which they were intended. In England they may indeed
amuse the public creditors, give hopes and expectations,
that shall be of some present use, and continue the
mismanagers a little longer in their places. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voila tout!</i></p>

<p>In return for your repeated advice to us, not to conclude
any treaty with the House of Bourbon, permit me to give
(through you) a little advice to the whigs in England.
Let nothing induce them to join with the tories in supporting
and continuing this wicked war against the whigs of
America, whose assistance they may hereafter want to
secure their own liberties; or whose country they may be
glad to retire to for the enjoyment of them.</p>

<p>If peace, by a treaty with America upon equal terms,
were really desired, your Commissioners need not go there
for it; supposing, as by the bill they are empowered "to
treat with such person or persons, as in their wisdom and
discretion they shall think meet," they should happen to
conceive, that the Commissioners of the Congress at Paris
might be included in that description.</p>

<p>I am ever, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> Seriously, on further thoughts, I am of opinion,
that if wise and honest men, such as Sir George Saville,
the Bishop of St Asaph, and yourself, were to come over
here immediately with powers to treat, you might not only
obtain peace with America, but prevent a war with France.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES HUTTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 24th, 1778.
</p>

<p>My dear old friend was in the right, not "to call in
question the sincerity of my words, where I say, February
the 12th, <em>we can treat if any propositions are made to us</em>."
They were true then, and are so still, if Britain has not
declared war with France; for in that case we shall undoubtedly
think ourselves obliged to continue the war as
long as she does. But methinks you should have taken us
at our word, and have sent immediately your propositions
in order to prevent such a war, if you did not choose it.
Still I conceive it would be well to do it, if you have not
already rashly begun the war. Assure yourself, nobody
more sincerely wishes perpetual peace among men than I
do; but there is a prior wish, that they would be equitable
and just, otherwise such peace is not possible, and indeed
wicked men have no right to expect it.</p>

<p>Adieu! I am ever yours most affectionately,</p>

<h3>NOTE FROM WILLIAM PULTNEY TO B. FRANKLIN.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p class="head">
March 29th, 1778.
</p>

<p>Mr Williams returned this morning to Paris, and will be
glad to see Dr Franklin, whenever it is convenient for the
Doctor, at the Hotel Frasiliere, Rue Tournon. It is near
the hotel where he lodged when the Doctor saw him a
fortnight ago. He does not propose to go abroad, and
therefore the Doctor will find him at any hour. He understands
that Mr Alexander is not yet returned from Dijon, which he regrets.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO WILLIAM PULTNEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 30th, 1778.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>When I first had the honor of conversing with you on
the subject of peace, I mentioned it as my opinion, that
every proposition, which implied our voluntarily agreeing
to return to a dependence on Britain, was now become impossible;
that a peace on equal terms undoubtedly might
be made; and that though we had no particular powers to
treat of peace with England, we had general powers to
make treaties of peace, amity, and commerce, with any
State in Europe, by which I thought we might be authorised
to treat with Britain; who, if sincerely disposed
to peace, might save time and much bloodshed by treating
with us directly.</p>

<p>I also gave it as my opinion, that in the treaty to be
made, Britain should endeavor, by the fairness and generosity
of the terms she offered, to recover the esteem,
confidence, and affection of America, without which the
peace could not be so beneficial, as it was not likely to
be lasting; in this I had the pleasure to find you of my
opinion.</p>

<p>But I see by the propositions you have communicated
to me, that the Ministers cannot yet divest themselves of
the idea, that the power of Parliament over us is constitutionally
absolute and unlimited; and that the limitations
they may be willing now to put to it by treaty are so
many favors, or so many benefits, for which we are to make
compensation.</p>

<p>As our opinions in America are totally different, a treaty
on the terms proposed appears to me utterly impracticable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
either here or there. Here we certainly cannot make it,
having not the smallest authority to make even the declaration
specified in the proposed letter, without which, if I
understood you right, treating with us cannot be commenced.</p>

<p>I sincerely wish as much for peace as you do, and I
have enough remaining of good will for England to wish
it for her sake as well as for our own, and for the sake of
humanity. In the present state of things, the proper means
of obtaining it, in my opinion, are to acknowledge the independence
of the United States, and then enter at once
into a treaty with us for a suspension of arms, with the usual
provisions relating to distances; and another for establishing
peace, friendship, and commerce, such as France has
made. This might prevent a war between you and that
kingdom, which in the present circumstances and temper
of the two nations an accident may bring on every day,
though contrary to the interest and without the previous
intention of either. Such a treaty we might probably now
make, with the approbation of our friends; but if you go
to war with them, on account of their friendship for us, we
are bound by ties, stronger than can be formed by any
treaty, to fight against you with them, as long as the war
against them shall continue.</p>

<p>May God at last grant that wisdom to your national
councils, which he seems long to have denied them, and
which only sincere, just, and humane intentions can merit
or expect.</p>

<p>With great personal esteem, I have the honor to be, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 24th, 1778</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Mr Hartley, a member of Parliament, an old acquaintance
of mine, arrived here from London on Sunday last.
He is generally in the opposition, especially on American
questions, but has some respect for Lord North. In conversation
he expressed the strongest anxiety for peace
with America, and appeared extremely desirous to know
my sentiments of the terms, which might probably be acceptable
if offered; whether America would not, to obtain
peace, grant some superior advantages in trade to Britain,
and enter into an alliance offensive and defensive; whether,
if war should be declared against France, we had obliged
ourselves by treaty to join with her against England.</p>

<p>My answers have been, that the United States were
not fond of war, and with the advice of their friends
would probably be easily prevailed with to make peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
on equitable terms; but we had no terms committed to
us to propose, and I did not choose to mention any; that
Britain, having injured us heavily by making this unjust
war upon us, might think herself well off, if <em>on reparation
of those injuries</em> we admitted her to <em>equal</em> advantages
with other nations in commerce; but certainly she
had no reason to expect <em>superior</em>; that her known fondness
for war, and the many instances of her readiness to
engage in wars on frivolous occasions, were probably sufficient
to cause an immediate rejection of every proposition
for an <em>offensive</em> alliance with her; and that if she
made war against France on our account, a peace with
us, at the same time, was impossible; for that having
met with friendship from that generous nation, when we
were cruelly oppressed by England, we were under
ties stronger than treaties could form, to make common
cause; which we should certainly do to the utmost of
our power.</p>

<p>Here has also been with me a Mr Chapman, who says
he is a member of the parliament of Ireland, on his way
home from Nice, where he had been for the recovery of
his health. He pretended to call on me only from motives
of respect for my character, &amp;c. But after a few
compliments, he entered on a similar discourse, urging
much to know what terms would satisfy America, and
whether, on having <em>peace and independence granted</em> to
us, we should not be willing to submit to the navigation
act, or give equivalent privileges in trade to Britain. The
purport of my answer to him was in short, that peace was
of equal value to England as to us, and independence we
were already in possession of; that, therefore, England's
offer to grant them to us could not be considered as proposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
any favor, or as giving her a right to expect peculiar
advantages in commerce. By his importunity, I
found his visit was not so occasional as he represented it;
and from some expressions, I conjectured he might be
sent by Lord Shelburne to sound me, and collect some information.
On the whole, I gather from these conversations,
that the opposition as well as the Ministry are perplexed
with the present situation of affairs, and know not
which way to turn themselves, whether it is best to go
backward or forward, or what steps to take to extricate
that nation from its present dangerous situation.</p>

<p>I thought it right to give your Excellency an account of
these interviews, and to acquaint you with my intention of
avoiding such hereafter, as I see but little prospect of utility
in them, and think they are very liable to hurtful misrepresentations.</p>

<p>By advices from London we learn, that a fleet for Quebec,
with goods valued at five hundred thousand pounds
sterling, is to sail about the end of this month, under convoy
only of a single frigate of thirty guns, in which is to go
Governor Haldimand.</p>

<p>Enclosed I send a paper I have just received from London.
It is not subscribed by any name, but I know the
hand. It is from an old friend of general and great acquaintance,
and marks strongly the present distress and
despair of considerate people in England.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your
Excellency's, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="head">
Versailles, April 25th, 1778.<br />
</p>

<p>I have made known to the King, Sir, the substance of
the letter, which you did me the honor of writing to me
yesterday; and I am directed by his Majesty to express
to you the satisfaction he has experienced from the information,
which you have communicated on your conferences
with Mr Hartley. The grand principle of the English
policy has always been to excite divisions; and it is by
such means she expects to sustain her empire; but it is
not upon you, nor upon your colleagues, that she can practise
such arts with success. I entertain the same sentiments
of confidence in the United States. As to the rest,
it is impossible to speak with more dignity, frankness, and
firmness, than you have done to Mr Hartley; he has no
reason to be very well satisfied with his mission. I doubt
whether this member of Parliament has any mission for
us; but he desires to see me, and I expect him in the
course of the morning. I should not be at all surprised,
if his purpose be to sow distrust between us, by proposing
a double negotiation. That I can obviate; but whatever
passes between us, however trifling it may be, you shall be
made acquainted with.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with the most perfect consideration,
Sir, your most humble and most obedient servant,</p>

<h3>ANSWER TO A LETTER FROM BRUSSELS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 1st, 1778.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received your letter, dated at Brussels the 16th past.</p>

<p>My vanity might possibly be flattered by your expressions
of compliment to my understanding, if your proposals
did not more clearly manifest a mean opinion of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>You conjure me in the name of the omniscient and just
God, before whom I must appear, and by my hopes of
future fame, to consider if some expedient cannot be found
to put a stop to the desolation of America, and prevent
the miseries of a general war. As I am conscious of
having taken every step in my power to prevent the
breach, and no one to widen it, I can appear cheerfully
before that God, fearing nothing from his justice
in this particular, though I have much occasion for his
mercy in many others. As to my future fame, I am
content to rest it on my past and present conduct, without
seeking an addition to it in the crooked, dark paths,
you propose to me, where I should most certainly lose it.
This, your solemn address, would therefore have been
more properly made to your sovereign and his venal
Parliament. He and they, who wickedly began, and
madly continue, a war for the desolation of America, are
alone accountable for the consequences.</p>

<p>You endeavor to impress me with a bad opinion of
French faith; but the instances of their friendly endeavors
to serve a race of weak princes, who, by their own imprudence,
defeated every attempt to promote their interest,
weigh but little with me, when I consider the steady
friendship of France to the Thirteen United States of
Switzerland, which has now continued inviolate two hundred
years. You tell me that she will certainly cheat us,
and that she despises us already. I do not believe that she
will cheat us, and I am not certain that she despises us;
but I see clearly that you are endeavoring to cheat us by
your conciliatory bills; that you actually despised our understandings
when you flattered yourselves those artifices
would succeed; and that not only France, but all Europe,
yourselves included, most certainly and for ever would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
despise us, if we were weak enough to accept your insidious
propositions.</p>

<p>Our expectations of the future grandeur of America are
not so magnificent, and therefore not so vain or visionary,
as you represent them to be. The body of our people
are not merchants, but humble husbandmen, who delight
in the cultivation of their lands, which, from their fertility
and the variety of our climates, are capable of furnishing
all the necessaries and conveniences of life without external
commerce; and we have too much land to have
the least temptation to extend our territory by conquest
from peaceable neighbors, as well as too much justice to
think of it. Our militia, you find by experience, are sufficient
to defend our lands from invasion; and the commerce
with us will be defended by all the nations who find
an advantage in it. We, therefore, have not the occasion
you imagine, of fleets, or standing armies, but may leave
those expensive machines to be maintained for the pomp
of princes, and the wealth of ancient states. We propose,
if possible, to live in peace with all mankind; and
after you have been convinced to your cost, that there
is nothing to be got by attacking us, we have reason to
hope that no other power will judge it prudent to quarrel
with us, lest they divert us from our own quiet industry,
and turn us into corsairs preying upon theirs.
The weight therefore of an independent empire, which
you seem certain of our inability to bear, will not be so
great as you imagine. The expense of our civil government
we have always borne, and can easily bear,
because it is small. A virtuous and laborious people may be
cheaply governed. Determining as we do, to have
no offices of profit, nor any sinecures or useless appointments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
so common in ancient or corrupted states, we can
govern ourselves a year, for the sum you pay in a single
department, or for what one jobbing contractor, by the
favor of a Minister, can cheat you out of in a single article.</p>

<p>You think we flatter ourselves, and are deceived into
an opinion that England <em>must</em> acknowledge our independency.
We, on the other hand, think you flatter
yourselves in imagining such an acknowledgment a vast
boon, which we strongly desire, and which you may
gain some great advantage by granting or withholding.
We have never asked it of you; we only tell you,
that you can have no treaty with us but as an independent
State; and you may please yourselves and
your children with the rattle of your right to govern us,
as long as you have done with that of your King's being
King of France, without giving us the least concern, if
you do not attempt to exercise it. That this pretended
right is indisputable, as you say, we utterly deny. Your
Parliament never had a right to govern us, and your King
has forfeited it by his bloody tyranny. But I thank you
for letting me know a little of your mind, that even if the
Parliament should acknowledge our independency, the
act would not be binding to posterity, and that your nation
would resume and prosecute the claim as soon as they
found it convenient from the influence of your passions,
and your present malice against us. We suspected before,
that you would not be actually bound by your conciliatory
acts, longer than till they had served their purpose
of inducing us to disband our forces; but we were not
certain, that you were knaves by principle, and that we
ought not to have the least confidence in your offers,
promises, or treaties, though confirmed by Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>I now indeed recollect my being informed, long since,
when in England, that a certain very great personage,
then young, studied much a certain book entitled <cite>Arcana
imperii</cite>. I had the curiosity to procure the book and read
it. There are sensible and good things in it, but some
bad ones; for, if I remember rightly, a particular king is
applauded for his politically exciting a rebellion among his
subjects, at a time when they had not strength to support
it, that he might, in subduing them, take away their privileges,
which were troublesome to him; and a question is
formally stated and discussed, <em>Whether a prince, who, to
appease a revolt, makes promises of indemnity to the
revolters, is obliged to fulfil those promises?</em> Honest
and good men would say, aye; but this politician says, as
you say, no. And he gives this pretty reason, that though
it was right to make the promises, because otherwise the
revolt would not be suppressed, yet it would be wrong to
keep them, because revolters ought to be punished to
deter future revolts.</p>

<p>If these are the principles of your nation, no confidence
can be placed in you; it is in vain to treat with you, and
the wars can only end in being reduced to an utter inability
of continuing them.</p>

<p>One main drift of your letter seems to be to impress me
with an idea of your own impartiality, by just censures of
your Ministers and measures, and to draw from me propositions
of peace, or approbations of those you have enclosed
to me, which you intimate may by your means be conveyed
to the King directly, without the intervention of those Ministers.
You would have me give them to, or drop them for,
a stranger whom I may find next Monday in the church of
Notre Dame, to be known by a rose in his hat. You yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Sir, are quite unknown to me; you have not trusted
me with your true name. Our taking the least step
towards a treaty with England through you, might, if you
are an enemy, be made use of to ruin us with our new and
good friends. I may be indiscreet enough in many things;
but certainly, if I were disposed to make propositions
(which I cannot do, having none committed to me to make)
I should never think of delivering them to the Lord knows
who, to be carried to the Lord knows where, to serve no
one knows what purposes. Being at this time one of the
most remarkable figures in Paris, even my appearance in
the church of Notre Dame, where I cannot have any
conceivable business, and especially being seen to leave or
drop any letter to any person there, would be a matter of
some speculation, and might, from the suspicions it must
naturally give, have very mischievous consequences to our
credit here. The very proposing of a correspondence so
to be managed, in a manner not necessary where fair dealing
is intended, gives just reason to suppose you intend the
contrary. Besides, as your Court has sent Commissioners
to treat with the Congress, with all the powers that
would be given them by the crown under the act of Parliament,
what good purpose can be served by privately
obtaining propositions from us? Before those Commissioners
went, we might have treated in virtue of our general
powers, (with the knowledge, advice, and approbation of
our friends) upon any propositions made to us. But
under the present circumstances, for us to make propositions,
while a treaty is supposed to be actually on foot
with the Congress, would be extremely improper, highly
presumptuous with regard to our constituents, and answer
no good end whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>I write this letter to you, notwithstanding, (which I think
I can convey in a less mysterious manner, and guess it
may come to your hands;) I write it because I would let
you know our sense of your procedure, which appears as
insidious as that of your conciliatory bills. Your true way
to obtain peace, if your Ministers desire it, is to propose
openly to the Congress fair and equal terms, and you may
possibly come sooner to such a resolution when you find
that personal flatteries, general cajolings, and panegyrics
on our <em>virtue</em> and <em>wisdom</em> are not likely to have the effect
you seem to expect; the persuading us to act basely and
foolishly in betraying our country and posterity into the
hands of our most bitter enemies, giving up or selling of
our arms and warlike stores, dismissing our ships of war
and troops, and putting those enemies in possession of our
forts and ports.</p>

<p>This proposition of delivering ourselves bound and gagged,
ready for hanging, without even a right to complain,
and without a friend to be found afterwards among all
mankind, you would have us embrace upon the faith of an
act of Parliament! Good God! an act of your Parliament!
This demonstrates that you do not yet know us,
and that you fancy we do not know you; but it is not
merely this flimsy faith that we are to act upon; you offer
us <em>hope</em>, the hope of <small>PLACES</small>, <small>PENSIONS</small>, and <small>PEERAGES</small>.
These, judging from yourselves, you think are motives
irresistible. This offer to corrupt us, Sir, is with me your
credential, and convinces me that you are not a private
volunteer in your application. It bears the stamp of British
court character. It is even the signature of your King.
But think for a moment in what light it must be viewed in
America. By <small>PLACES</small>, you mean places among us, for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
take care by a special article to secure your own to yourselves.
We must then pay the salaries in order to enrich
ourselves with these places. But you will give us <small>PENSIONS</small>,
probably to be paid too out of your expected American
revenue, and which none of us can accept without
deserving, and perhaps obtaining, a <small>SUS</small>-<em>pension</em>. <small>PEERAGES</small>!
alas! Sir, our long observation of the vast servile
majority of your peers, voting constantly for every measure
proposed by a minister, however weak or wicked, leaves
us small respect for that title. We consider it as a sort of
<em>tar-and-feather</em> honor, or a mixture of foulness and folly,
which every man among us, who should accept it from
your King, would be obliged to renounce, or exchange for
that conferred by the mobs of their own country, or wear
it with everlasting infamy.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 22d, 1778.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received your favor of May 15th, and was glad to find
that mine of December 25th had come to hand. Mr
Deane's brother writes it was not signed, which was an accidental
omission. Mr Deane is himself I hope with you
long before this time, and I doubt not every prejudice
against him is removed. It was not alone upon the proceedings
of Congress, that I formed my opinion that such
prejudices existed. I am glad to understand that opinion
was groundless, and that he is likely to come back with
honor in the commission to Holland, where matters are
already so ripe for his operations, that he cannot fail
(with his abilities) of being useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>You mention former letters of the Committee, by which
we might have seen the apprehensions of the resentment of
foreign officers, &amp;c. Those letters never came to hand.
And we, on our part, are amazed to hear, that the Committee
had had no line from us for near a year, during
which we had written, I believe, five or six long and particular
letters, and had made it a rule to send triplicates of
each, and to replace those that we happened to hear were
lost, so that of some there were five copies sent, and as I
hear that Captain Young is arrived, who had some of
them, I think it probable that one of each, at least, must
have come to your hands before this time. Mr Deane's
information, however, may supply the want of them,
whose arrival, as he went with a strong squadron of men
of war, is more likely than that of this vessel, or any other
single one by which we might send more copies.</p>

<p>The affair with M. de Beaumarchais will be best settled
by his assistance after his return. We find it recommended
to us, but we know too little of it to be able to
do it well without him.</p>

<p>There has been some inaccuracy in sending us the last
despatches of the Committee. Two copies of the contract
with M. Francy, and the invoices came by the same
vessel, Captain Niles. And though one of your letters
mentions sending enclosed a resolution of Congress, relative
to two articles of the treaty, that resolution is not
come to hand. There are circumstances in the affair of
those articles, that make them, in my opinion, of no consequence
if they stand, while the proposing to abrogate
them has an unpleasing appearance, as it looks like a
desire of having it in our power to make that commercial
kind of war, which no honest State can begin, which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
good friend or neighbor ever did, will begin, which has
always been considered as an act of hostility, that provoked
as well as justified reprisals, and has generally produced
such as rendered the first project as unprofitable as it was
unjust. Commerce among nations, as well as between
private persons, should be fair and equitable, by equivalent
exchanges and mutual supplies. The taking unfair
advantage of a neighbor's necessities, though attended with
temporary success, always breeds bad blood. To lay
duties on a commodity exported, which our neighbors
want, is a knavish attempt to get something for nothing.
The statesman who first invented it had the genius of a
pickpocket, and would have been a pickpocket if fortune
had suitably placed him. The nations, who have practised
it, have suffered fourfold as pickpockets ought to suffer.
Savoy, by a duty on exported wines, lost the trade of
Switzerland, which thenceforth raised its own wine; and
(to waive other instances) Britain, by her duty on exported
tea, has lost the trade of her Colonies. But as we produce
no commodity that is peculiar to our country, and
which may not be obtained elsewhere, the discouraging
the consumption of ours by duties on exportation, and
thereby encouraging a rivalship from other nations in the
ports we trade to, is absolute folly, which indeed is mixed
more or less with all knavery. For my own part, if my
protest were of any consequence, I should protest against
our ever doing it, even by way of reprisal. It is a meanness
with which I would not dirty the conscience or character
of my country.</p>

<p>The objections stated against the last of the two articles,
had all been made and considered here; and were sent,
I imagine, from hence by one who is offended, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
were not thought of weight sufficient to stop the signing of
the treaty, till the King should, in another council, reconsider
those articles, and after agreeing to omit them, order
new copies to be drawn, though all was then ready engrossed
on parchment as before settled. I did not think
the articles of much consequence; but I thought it of consequence,
that no delay should be given to the signing of
the treaty after it was ready. But if I had known that
those objections would have been sent to the Committee, I
should have sent the answers they received, which had
been satisfactory to <em>all</em> the Commissioners when the treaty
was settled, and until the mind of one<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of them was
altered by the opinion of two other persons.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is now
too late to send those answers. But I wish for the future,
if such a case should again happen, that Congress would
acquaint their Commissioners with such partial objections,
and hear their reasons before they determine that they
have done wrong. In the meantime this only to you in
private; it will be of no use to communicate it, as the
resolutions of Congress will probably be received and
executed before this letter comes to hand.</p>

<p>Speaking of Commissioners in the plural, puts me in
mind of inquiring if it can be the intention of Congress to
keep <em>three</em> Commissioners at this Court; we have indeed
four with the gentleman intended for Tuscany, who continues
here, and is very angry that he was not consulted in
making the treaty, which he could have mended in several
particulars; and perhaps he is angry with some reason, if
the instructions to him do, as he says they do, require us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to consult him. We shall soon have a fifth, for the envoy
to Vienna not being received there, is, I hear, returning
hither. The necessary expense of maintaining us all, is,
I assure you, enormously great. I wish that the utility
may equal it. I imagine every one of us spends nearly as
much as Lord Stormont did. It is true, he left behind
him the character of a niggard; and when the advertisement
appeared for the sale of his household goods, all
Paris laughed at an article of it, perhaps very innocently
expressed, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une grande quantité du linge de table, qui
n'a jamais servi." "Cela est tres vraisemblable,</i>" say
they, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">car il n'a jamais donné à manger.</i>" But as to
our number, whatever advantage there might be in the
joint counsels of three for framing and adjusting the articles
of the treaty, there can be none in managing the
common business of a resident here. On the contrary, all
the advantages in negotiation that result from secrecy of
sentiment, and uniformity in expressing it, and in common
business from despatch, are lost. In a Court, too,
where every word is watched and weighed, if a number of
Commissioners do not every one hold the same language,
in giving their opinion on any public transaction, this
lessens their weight; and when it may be prudent to put
on, or avoid certain appearances of concern, for example,
or indifference, satisfaction, or dislike, where the utmost
sincerity and candor should be used, and would gain credit,
if no semblance of art showed itself in the inadvertent discourse,
perhaps of only one of them, the hazard is in proportion
to the number. And where every one must be
consulted on every particular of common business, in answering
every letter, &amp;c. and one of them is offended if
the smallest thing is done without his consent, the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of being often and long enough together, the different
opinions, and the time consumed in debating them, the
interruptions by new applicants in the time of meeting,
&amp;c. &amp;c. occasion so much postponing and delay, that correspondence
languishes, occasions are lost, and the business
is always behindhand.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the difficulty of being often and long
enough together; this is considerable, where they cannot
all be accommodated in the same house; but to find three
people whose tempers are so good, and who like so well
one another's company and manner of living and conversing,
as to agree well themselves, though being in one
house, and whose servants will not by their indiscretion
quarrel with one another, and by artful misrepresentations
draw their masters in to take their parts, to the disturbance
of necessary harmony, these are difficulties still
greater and almost insurmountable. And in consideration
of the whole, I wish Congress would separate us.</p>

<p>The Spanish galiots, which have been impatiently expected,
are at length happily arrived. The fleet and
army returning from Brazil is still out, but supposed to be
on the way homewards. When that and the South Sea
ships are arrived, it will appear whether Spain's accession
to the treaty has been delayed for the reasons given, or
whether the reasons were only given to excuse the delay.</p>

<p>The English and French fleets of nearly equal force
are now both at sea. It is not doubted but that if they
meet, there will be a battle, for though England through
fear affects to understand it to be still peace, and would
excuse the depredations she has made on the commerce of
France, by pretences of illicit trade, &amp;c. yet France considers
the war begun, from the time of the King's message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to Parliament, complaining of the insult France had given
by treating with us, and demanding aids to resist it, and the
answer of both Houses offering their lives and fortunes.
And the taking several frigates are deemed indisputable
hostilities. Accordingly, orders are given to all the fleets
and armed ships to return hostilities, and encouragement
is offered to privateers, &amp;c. An Ambassador from Spain
is indeed gone to London, and joyfully received there, in
the idea that peace may be made by his mediation. But
as yet we learn nothing certain of his mission, and doubt
his effecting anything of the kind.</p>

<p>War in Germany seems to be inevitable, and this occasioning
great borrowings of money in Holland and elsewhere,
by the powers concerned, makes it more difficult
for us to succeed in ours. When we engaged to Congress
to pay their bills for the interest of the sums they should
borrow, we did not dream of their drawing on us for other
occasions. We have already paid of Congress' drafts,
to returned officers, eightytwo thousand two hundred and
eleven livres, and we know not how much more of that
kind we have to pay, because the Committee have never
let us know the amount of those drafts, or their account
of them never reached us, and they still continue coming
in. And we are now surprised with advice of drafts
from Mr Bingham, to the amount of one hundred thousand
more. If you reduce us to bankruptcy here, by a nonpayment
of your drafts, consider the consequences.
In my humble opinion, no drafts should be made on us
without first learning from us that we shall be able to
answer them.</p>

<p>M. de Beaumarchais has been out of town ever since the
arrival of your power to settle with him. I hope he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
be able to furnish the supplies mentioned in the invoice and
contract. The settlement may be much better made with
the assistance of Mr Deane, we being not privy to the
transactions.</p>

<p>We have agreed to give Monsieur Dumas two hundred
louis a year, thinking that he well deserves it.</p>

<p>With great esteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS TO B. FRANKLIN, AS MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY
TO THE COURT OF FRANCE.</h3>

<p>We, the Congress of the United States of North America,
having thought it proper to appoint you their Minister
Plenipotentiary to the Court of His Most Christian Majesty,
you shall in all things, according to the best of your
knowledge and abilities, promote the interest and honor
of the said States, at that Court, with a particular attention
to the following instructions.</p>

<p>1. You are immediately to assure His Most Christian
Majesty, that these States entertain the highest sense of his
exertions in their favor, particularly by sending the respectable
squadron under the Count d'Estaing, which would
probably have terminated the war in a speedy and honorable
manner, if unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances
had not intervened.</p>

<p>You are further to assure him, that they consider this
speedy aid not only as a testimony of his Majesty's fidelity
to the engagements he has entered into, but as an earnest
of that protection, which they hope from his power and
magnanimity, and as a bond of gratitude to the union,
founded on mutual interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>2. You shall, by the earliest opportunity, and on every
necessary occasion, assure the King and his Ministers, that
neither the Congress, nor any of the States they represent,
have at all swerved from their determination to be independent
in July, 1776. But as the declaration was made in
the face of the most powerful fleet and army, which could
have been expected to operate against them, and without
any the slightest assurance of foreign aid, so, although
in a defenceless situation, and harassed by the secret
machinations and designs of intestine foes, they have, under
the exertions of that force, during those bloody campaigns,
persevered in their determination to be free. And that
they have been inflexible in this determination, notwithstanding
the interruption of their commerce, the great sufferings
they have experienced from the want of those
things, which it procured, and the unexampled barbarity of
their enemies.</p>

<p>3. You are to give the most pointed and positive assurances,
that although the Congress are earnestly desirous of
peace, as well to arrange their finances and recruit the
exhausted state of their country, as to spare the further
effusion of blood, yet they will faithfully perform their
engagements, and afford every assistance in their power
to prosecute the war for the great purposes of the alliance.</p>

<p>4. You shall endeavor to obtain the King's consent to
expunge from the treaty of commerce the eleventh and
twelfth articles, as inconsistent with that equality and reciprocity,
which form the best security to perpetuate the
whole.</p>

<p>5. You are to exert yourself to procure the consent of
the Court of France, that all American seamen, who may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
be taken on board of British vessels, may, if they choose,
be permitted to enter on board of American vessels. In
return for which, you are authorised to stipulate, that all
Frenchmen who may be taken on board of British vessels,
by vessels belonging to the United States, shall be delivered
up to persons appointed for that purpose by His Most
Christian Majesty.</p>

<p>6. You are to suggest to the Ministers of His Most
Christian Majesty the advantage, that would result from
entering on board the ships of these States British seamen,
who may be made prisoners, thereby impairing the
force of the enemy, and strengthening the hands of his
ally.</p>

<p>7. You are also to suggest the fatal consequences, which
would follow to the commerce of the common enemy,
if, by confining the war to the European and Asiatic seas,
the coasts of America could be so far freed from the British
fleets, as to furnish a safe asylum to the frigates and
privateers of the allied nations and their prizes.</p>

<p>8. You shall constantly inculcate the certainty of ruining
the British fisheries on the Banks of Newfoundland, and
consequently the British Marine, by reducing Halifax and
Quebec; since, by that means they would be exposed to
alarm and plunder, and deprived of the necessary supplies
formerly drawn from America. The plan proposed to
Congress for compassing these objects is herewith transmitted
for your more particular instruction.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>9. You are to lay before the Court the deranged state
of our finances, together with the causes thereof; and show
the necessity of placing them on a more respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
footing, in order to prosecute the war with vigor on the
part of America. Observations on that subject are herewith
transmitted,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and more particular instructions shall be
sent, whenever the necessary steps previous thereto shall
have been taken.</p>

<p>10. You are, by every means in your power, to promote
a perfect harmony, concord, and good understanding,
not only between the allied powers, but also between and
among their subjects, that the connexion so favorably begun
may be perpetuated.</p>

<p>11. You shall in all things take care not to make any
engagements, or stipulations, on the part of America, without
the consent of America previously obtained.</p>

<p>We pray God to further you with his goodness in the
several objects hereby recommended; and that he will
have you in his holy keeping.</p>

<p>Done at Philadelphia, the 26th day of October, 1778.</p>

<p>We must earnestly request, that, as we shall have opportunities
of frequently conveying to you gazettes and other
species of intelligence, you would strive to communicate,
in the speediest and best way, to the gentlemen at the

last,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> by which he is invited to become a member of

and the satisfaction with which he reflects on the favorable
opinion of him which has occasioned it. But he knows
himself not to be sufficiently qualified for giving such assistance;
and he is so connected in this country, and also advancing
so fast in the evening of life, that he cannot think of
a removal. He requests the favor of the Honorable Commissioners
to transmit this reply to Congress; with assurances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that Dr Price feels the warmest gratitude for the notice

<h3>LETTER RESPECTING CAPTAIN COOK.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 10th, 1779.
</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging2">To all Captains and Commanders of armed Ships, acting
by Commission from the Congress of the United States
of America, now at War with Great Britain.</p></blockquote>

<p class="open">
Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>A ship having been fitted out from England, before the
commencement of this war, to make discoveries of new
countries in unknown seas, under the conduct of that most
celebrated navigator, Captain Cook,&mdash;an undertaking
truly laudable in itself, as the increase of geographical
knowledge facilitates the communication between distant
nations, in the exchange of useful products and manufactures,
and the extension of arts, whereby the common enjoyments
of human life are multiplied and augmented, and
science of other kinds increased, to the benefit of mankind
in general.</p>

<p>This is therefore most earnestly to recommend to every
one of you, that in case the said ship, which is now expected
to be soon in the European seas on her return,
should happen to fall into your hands, you would not consider
her as an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made
of the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate
return to England, by detaining her or sending her into
any other part of Europe or America, but that you would
treat the said Captain Cook and his people with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
civility and kindness, affording them, as common friends
to mankind, all the assistance in your power, which they
may happen to stand in need of. In so doing, you will
not only gratify the generosity of your own dispositions,
but there is no doubt of your obtaining the approbation
of Congress, and of your own American owners.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 21st, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received duly yours of the 2d instant. I am sorry
you have had so much trouble in the affair of the prisoners.
You have been deceived as well as I. No cartel
ship has yet appeared; and it is now evident, that the
delays have been of design, to give more opportunity of
seducing the men by promises and hardships to seek
their liberty in engaging against their country; for we
learn from those who have escaped, that there are persons
continually employed in cajoling and menacing them; representing
to them that we neglect them; that your government
is willing to exchange them; and that it is our
fault it is not done; that all the news from America is
bad on their side; we shall be conquered and they will
be hanged, if they do not accept the gracious offer of
being pardoned, on condition of serving the King, &amp;c.
A great part of your prisoners have been kept these six
months on board a ship in Brest road, ready to be delivered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
where I am afraid they were not so comfortably
accommodated, as they might have been in French
prisons. They are now ordered on shore. Doctor Bancroft
has received your letter here. He did not go to Calais.</p>

<p>Knowing how earnestly and constantly you wish for
peace, I cannot end a letter to you without dropping a
word on that subject, to mark that my wishes are still in
unison with yours. After the barbarities your nation has
exercised against us, I am almost ashamed to own that I
feel sometimes for her misfortunes and her insanities.
Your veins are open, and your best blood continually running.
You have now got a little army into Georgia, and
are triumphing in that success. Do you expect ever to see
that army again? I know not what General Lincoln or General
Thomson may be able to effect against them, but if
they stay through the summer in that climate, there is a
certain <em>General Fever</em>, that I apprehend will give a good
account of most of them. Perhaps you comfort yourselves
that our loss of blood is as great as yours. But as physicians
say, there is a great difference in the facility of repairing
that loss between an old body and a young one. America
adds to her numbers annually one hundred and fifty
thousand souls. She, therefore, grows faster than you can
diminish her, and will out-grow all the mischief you can
do her. Have you the same prospects? But it is unnecessary
for me to represent to you, or you to me, the
mischiefs that each nation is subjected to by the war; we
all see clear enough the nonsense of continuing it; the
difficulty is, where to find sense enough to put an end to it.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, April 22d, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>The bearer of this, and some other papers, is a very
sensible and worthy gentleman, with whom I had the
pleasure of contracting an acquaintance since the commencement
of the American troubles, originally upon the
business of the American prisoners. It is a satisfaction to
me at all times to have found him a friend to the restoration
of peace between the two countries. It has likewise
been an additional satisfaction and confirmation to me in
my own thoughts upon that subject, to find that his sentiments,
I think upon most, or all of the subjects upon
which we have conversed, have coincided with mine.
We both seem possessed of the opinion, that some plan of
opening a negotiation upon preliminaries, which each side
might find to be a sufficient security to itself, might be
practicable; and then your sentiment, which you gave
me in a letter some years ago, might have its free scope
and effect, viz, <em>A little time given for cooling might
have excellent effects</em>.</p>

<p>The sentiments I have opened to you in my late letters
for some months past, and which I have reduced in an
enclosed paper into a more specific shape, seem to me,
upon very repeated reflection, to promise the fairest
ground of good expectation. These propositions originate
from myself, as a mediator; I have communications
with both sides, but certainly no authority to make proposals
from either; and perhaps neither side, if I were to
make the propositions separately to each, (being myself
unauthorised) might give me positive consent. Each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
separately might say, No, from what is called political
prudence; and yet each side might secretly wish that the
offer could be made, with a <em>done first</em>, from the other
party. I think the proposition of a truce for five or seven
years, leaving all things in the present dispute <em>in status quo</em>,
must be advantageous to all parties, if it were only in consideration
that a general satisfactory peace to all parties
<em>may</em> come among the <em>excellent effects of time given for
cooling</em>. We can but fight it out at last. War never
comes too late; wisdom may step in between. These
matters have stolen upon us, and have arisen to great and
formidable consequences, from small and unexpected beginnings;
but henceforward, we should know by experience
what to expect. If the rage of war could but be
abated for a sufficient length of time for reason and reflection
to operate, I think it would never revive. I cannot
pretend to forecast the result of any negotiation, but I think
war would not revive; which is all that I want for my
argument. Peace is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonum in se</i>; whereas the most
favorable events of war are but relatively lesser evils; certainly
they are evils; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala in se</i>, not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona in se</i>.</p>

<p>I hope that a cessation of hostilities would produce a renewal
of reflection; but even to take the argument at the
worst advantage, the two parties are at a cooling distance
of three thousand miles asunder. If the flames of war
could be but once extinguished, does not the Atlantic
ocean contain cold water enough to prevent them bursting
out again? I am very strongly of opinion that the two
nations of Great Britain and North America, would accord
to the proposition of a truce <em>for cooling</em>. I cannot
say whether a British ministry would accord to it, because
they will not tell me; nor can I say whether an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Plenipotentiary would accord to it, because, probably, you
will not tell me. I put myself into your hands, however,
when I tell you frankly, I am of opinion that both would
accord to it, if there could be a <em>done first</em> on either side,
to bind the bargain fast. You have the odds of me in this
matter, because you know one half of the question; and
I cannot give you any proof on the other side, but only
my own presumptive judgment upon observation, and
upon a course of reasoning in my own thoughts.</p>

<p>But for France. My judgment would be, that if the
proposition of the proposed preliminaries should be agreeable
to America, France would do very unhandsomely
to defeat it by their refusal. I likewise think it the interest
of France, because their interest leads them to go
to a certain point, and no further. There is a disparity
in the operation of the terms of the alliance on the part
of France, and on the part of America. The more vigorously
France interposes, the better for America; in
proportion to their exertions, they create, less or more,
a diversion of the British force; this reasoning goes
straight forward for America; but it is not so with
France. There is a certain point to France, beyond
which their work would fail, and recoil upon themselves;
if they were to drive the British Ministry totally to abandon
the American war, it would become totally a French
war. The events of a twelvemonth past seem to bear testimony
to this course of reasoning. The disadvantage upon
the bargain to America is, that the efficacy of the French
alliance to them presupposes their continuance in the war.
The demur to France is, that the liberation of their new
ally recoils with double weight of the war upon themselves,
without any ulterior points of advantage in view, as dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
upon that alliance. I think the interest of all
parties coincides with the proposition of preliminaries.</p>

<p>The proposed preliminaries appear to me to be just
and equitable to all parties; but the great object with me
is to come to some preliminaries. I could almost add,
whatever those preliminaries might be, provided a suspension
of arms for an adequate term of years were one, I
think it would be ten thousand to one against any future
renewal of the war. It is not necessary to enter at large
into the reasons which induce me to think, that the British
Ministry, as well as the American Plenipotentiary, would
consent to the terms of the proposed preliminaries; for
indeed I do not know that I am founded in that opinion
with respect to either, but still I believe it of both. But
what can a private person do in such a case, wishing to be
a mediator for peace, having access to both parties, but
equally uncertain of the reception of his mediation on
either side? I must hesitate to take any public step, as by
a proposition in Parliament, or by any other means to
drive the parties to an explanation upon any specific proposals;
and yet I am very unwilling to let the session pass
without some proposition, upon which the parties may
meet, if they should be so inclined, as I suspect them to
be. I have been endeavoring to feel pulses for some
months, but all is dumb show. I cannot say that I meet
with anything discouraging, to my apprehension, either as
to equitableness or practicability of the proposition for preliminaries.
If I could but simply receive sufficient encouragement,
that I should not run any hazard of obstructing
any other practicable propositions by obtruding mine,
I should be very much satisfied to come forward in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
case with mine, to furnish a beginning at least, which
might lead to peace.</p>

<p>There is nothing that I wish so much as to have an
opportunity of seeing and conversing with you, having
many things to say to you; but if that cannot yet happen,
I have only to say, that whatever communication you may
think proper to make to me, which may lead to peace, you
may be assured that I shall be most strenuous in applying
it to that end. In all cases of difficulty in human
life, there must be confidence somewhere, to enable us to
extricate nations from the evils attendant upon national
disputes, as they arise out of national passions, jealousies,
and points of honor. I am not sure whether the extreme
caution and diffidence of persons in political life be not
the cause, almost as frequently, of the unnecessary protraction
of the miseries of war, as of the final production
of any superior good to any State. Peace now is better
than peace a twelvemonth hence, at least by all the lives
that may be lost in the meanwhile, and by all the accumulated
miseries that may intervene by that delay. When
I speak of the necessity of confidence, I would not have
you to think, that I trust to all professions, promiscuously,
with confidence; my thoughts are free respecting all
parties; and for myself, if I thought it necessary for the
end of attaining any additional confidence in your esteem,
to enable me to co-operate the more effectually towards
the restoration of peace, there is nothing that I would
wish you to be assured of but this; that no fallacious
offers of insincerity, nor any pretexts for covering secret
designs, or for obtaining unfair advantages, shall ever pass
through my hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Believe me truly to be, not only a lover of my country,
but a sincere friend to peace and to the rights of mankind;
and ever most affectionately yours.</p>

<p class="signature">
D. HARTLEY.
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center"><em>Observations by Mr Hartley.</em></p>

<p>Lord North consented to Mr Hartley's proposition, for
endeavoring to procure from the American Plenipotentiary
or Plenipotentiaries some opening, that they would be
willing to commence a parley, on propositions of peace
between Great Britain and America; and supposed the
terms, which Mr Hartley had in view, would be something
like a tacit cession of independence to America, with a
truce for a certain term of years, to serve as a basis for
a general treaty of accommodation and final settlement.</p>

<p>This last application (which was made on the 20th of
April, 1779) of Mr Hartley to Lord North, after several
previous conferences on the subject, is the ground of the
present confidential communication with Dr Franklin, on
the part of Mr Hartley, who states to Dr Franklin, as he
did to Lord North, that an auspicious beginning of a negotiation
is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dimidium facti</i>.</p>

<p>Mr Hartley's ideas of the probable course of the negotiation
would be to the following effect;</p>

<p>1. Five Commissioners (or any three of them) to be
appointed on the part of His Britannic Majesty to treat,
consult, and agree upon the final settlement and pacification
of the present troubles, upon safe, honorable, and permanent
terms, subject to ratification by Parliament.</p>

<p>2. That any one of the aforesaid Commissioners may
be empowered to agree, as a preliminary, to a suspension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of hostilities by sea and land, for a certain term of five
or seven years.</p>

<p>3. That any one of the aforesaid Commissioners be
empowered to agree, as a second preliminary, to suspend
the operation and effect of any and all acts of Parliament
respecting America, for a certain term of five or seven
years.</p>

<p>4. That it is expected, as a third preliminary, that
America should be released, free and unengaged, from any
treaties with foreign powers, which may tend to embarrass
or defeat the present proposed negotiation.</p>

<p>5. That a general treaty for negotiation shall be set on
foot as soon as may be, after the agreement of the foregoing
preliminaries.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><em>N. B.</em> A doubt seeming to arise from Lord North,
relative to the probability of any explanatory communication
on the part of Dr Franklin, Mr Hartley expressed,
he thought it possible, that as a known friend to peace,
he might be considered by Dr Franklin as a depot of
any communications, which may serve from time to time
to facilitate the terms of peace; which therefore prevents
this communication from being considered as any direct
overture from Lord North to Dr Franklin, or from Dr
Franklin to Lord North; but as it is merely a mediatorial
proposition of Mr Hartley, as a private person, for
the purpose of bringing the parties to a parley.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<blockquote><p class="hanging2"><em>To John Paul Jones, Commander of the American
Squadron in the Service of the United States, now in
the Port of L'Orient.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>1st. His Majesty, having been pleased to grant some
troops for a particular expedition, proposed to annoy our
common enemy, in which the sea-force under your command
might have an opportunity of distinguishing itself,
you are to receive on board the ships of war, and the other
vessels destined for that purpose, the troops that shall present
themselves to you, afford them such accommodation
as may be most proper for preserving their health, and
convey them to such port or place as their commander shall
desire to land them at.</p>

<p>2dly. When the troops are landed, you are to aid, by
all means in your power, their operations, as they will be
instructed in like manner to aid and support those you may
make with your ships, that so by this concurrence and union
of your different forces, all that such a compounded
strength is capable of may be effected.</p>

<p>3dly. You are during the expedition never to depart
from the troops, so as not to be able to protect them in
case of a repulse, and in all events you are to endeavor
to effect their complete re-embarkation on board the ships
and transports under your command, when the expedition
shall be ended.</p>

<p>4thly. You are to bring to France all the English seamen
you may happen to take prisoners, in order to complete
the good work you have already made such progress
in, of delivering by an exchange the rest of our countrymen
now languishing in the gaols of Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>5thly. As many of your officers and people have lately
escaped from English prisons, either in Europe or America,
you are to be particularly attentive to their conduct towards
the prisoners, which the fortune of war may throw into your
hands, lest resentment of the more than barbarous usage by
the English in many places towards the Americans should
occasion a retaliation, and an imitation of what ought rather
to be detested and avoided, for the sake of humanity and
for the honor of our country.</p>

<p>6thly. In the same view, although the English have
burnt wantonly many defenceless towns in America, you
are not to follow this example, unless where a reasonable
ransom is refused, in which case your own generous feelings,
as well as this instruction, will induce you to give
timely notice of your intention, that sick and ancient persons,
women, and children may be first removed.</p>

<p class="close">Done at Passy, this 28th day of April, 1779.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 4th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received your several favors, viz. one of April the 10th,
one of the 20th, and two of the 22d, all on the same day,
but by different conveyances.</p>

<p>I need not repeat, what we have each of us so often repeated,
the wish for peace. I will begin, by frankly assuring
you, that though I think a direct, immediate peace, the
best mode of present accommodation for Britain, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for America, yet if that <em>is not</em> at this time practicable, and
a truce is practicable, I should not be against a truce; but
this is merely on motives of <em>general humanity</em>, to obviate
the evils men devilishly inflict on men in time of war, and
to lessen as much as possible the similarity of earth and
hell. For with regard to particular advantages, respecting
the States I am connected with, I am persuaded it is
theirs to continue the war, till England shall be reduced to
that perfect impotence of mischief, which alone can prevail
with her to let other nations enjoy, "<em>Peace, Liberty, and
Safety</em>." I think, however, that a <em>short</em> truce, which must,
therefore, be an <em>armed</em> truce, and put all parties to an almost
equal expense with a continued war, is by no means
desirable.</p>

<p>But this proposition of a truce, if made at all, should be
made to France at the same time it is made to America.
They have each of them too much honor, as well as too
much sense, to listen separately to any propositions, which
tend to separate them from each other.</p>

<p>I will now give you my thoughts on your ideas of a
negotiation, in the order you have placed them. If you
will number them in your copy, you will readily see to
which my observations refer, and I may therefore be more
concise.</p>

<p><em>To the 1st</em>,&mdash;I do not see the necessity or use of five
Commissioners. A number of talkers lengthens discussions,
and often embarrasses instead of aiding a settlement.
Their different particular views, private interests, and jealousies
of each other, are likewise so many rubs in the way,
and it sometimes happens, that a number cannot agree to
what each privately thinks reasonable, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
agreed to, or perhaps proposed, if alone. But this as the
parties please.</p>

<p><em>To the 2d</em>,&mdash;The term of twentyone years would be better
for all sides. The suspension of hostilities should be
expressed to be between all parties at war; and that the
British troops and ships of war now in any of the United
States be withdrawn.</p>

<p><em>To the 3d</em>,&mdash;This seems needless, and is a thing that may
be done or omitted as you please; America has no concern
about those acts of parliament.</p>

<p><em>To the 4th</em>,&mdash;The reason of proposing this is not understood,
nor the use of it, nor what inducement there can be
for us to agree to it. When you come to treat with both
your enemies, you may negotiate away as much of these
engagements as you can; but powers, who have made a
firm solid league, evidently useful to both, can never be
prevailed with to dissolve it, for the vague expectation of
another <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in nubibus</i>; nor even on the certainty, that another
will be proposed, without knowing what are to be its articles.
America has no desire of being free from her engagements
to France. The chief is, that of continuing
the war in conjunction with her, and not making a separate
peace; and this is an obligation not in the power of America
to dissolve, being an obligation of <em>gratitude and justice</em>
towards a nation, which is engaged in a war on her account,
and for her protection; and would be forever binding,
whether such an article existed or not in the treaty; and
though it did not exist, an honest American would cut off
his right hand, rather than sign an agreement with England
contrary to the spirit of it.</p>

<p><em>To the 5th</em>,&mdash;As soon as you please.</p>

<p>If you had mentioned France in your proposed suspension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of arms, I should have immediately shown it to the
Minister, and have endeavored to support that idea. As it
stands, I am in doubt whether I shall communicate your
paper or not, though by your writing it is so fair it seems
as if you intended it. If I do, I shall acquaint you with
the result.</p>

<p>The bill, of which you send me a copy, was an excellent
one at the time, and might have had great and good
effects, if, instead of telling us haughtily, that our humble
petition should receive no answer, the Ministry had
received and enacted that bill into a law. It might have
erected a wall of brass round England, if such a measure
had been adopted, when Friar Bacon's brazen head cried
out, <small>TIME IS</small>! But the wisdom of it was not seen, till after
the fatal cry of <small>TIME'S PAST</small>!</p>

<p>I am, my dear friend, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE COMMITTEE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 26th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, who arrived here the 11th of
February, brought me yours of October 28th, and the new
commission, credentials, and instructions, which the Congress
have honored me with. I have not since had an opportunity
of writing, that I could trust, for I see by several
instances, the orders given to private captains to throw their
despatches into the sea, when likely to be taken, are sometimes
neglected, and sometimes so badly executed, that the
letters are recovered by the enemy, and much inconvenience
has attended their interception. You mention, that you
should speedily have opportunities of forwarding duplicates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and triplicates of the papers; none of them has ever come
to hand, nor have I received any other line from you of
later date.</p>

<p>I immediately acquainted the Minister of Foreign Affairs
with my appointment, and communicated to him as usual,
a copy of my credential letter, on which a day was named
for my reception. A fit of the gout prevented my attendance
at that time, and for some weeks after, but as soon
as I was able to go through the ceremony I went to Versailles,
and was presented to the King, and received in all
the forms. I delivered the letter of Congress into his Majesty's
own hands, who in the most gracious manner expressed
his satisfaction. And I have since constantly
attended the levee every Tuesday, with the other Foreign
Ministers, and have taken every proper occasion of repeating
the assurances I am instructed to give, of the grateful
sentiments of Congress, and their determined resolution to
fulfil religiously their engagements. Much pains is constantly
taken by the enemy to weaken the confidence of
this Court in their new allies, by representing our people
as weary of the war, and of the government of Congress;
which body, too, they represent as distracted by dissensions,
&amp;c. but all this has very little effect; and when on some
occasions it has seemed to make a little impression, and
create some apprehensions, I have not found it difficult to
remove them. And it is my firm opinion, that notwithstanding
the great losses suffered by the commerce of this
kingdom, since the commencement of the war, the disposition
of the Court to continue it (till its purpose of establishing
our independence is completed,) is not the least
changed, nor their regard for us diminished.</p>

<p>The end of that part of the instructions, which relates to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
American seamen, taken by the French in English ships,
had already been obtained, Captain Jones having had for
some time an order from Court, directed to the keepers of
the prisoners, requiring them to deliver to him such Americans
as should be found in their hands, that they might be
at liberty to serve under his command. Most of them have
accordingly been delivered to him, if not all. The Minister
of the Marine, having entertained a high opinion of him,
from his conduct and bravery in taking the Drake, was desirous
of employing him in the command of a particular
enterprise, and to that end requested us to spare him,
which we did, and sent the Ranger home, under the command
of his Lieutenant. Various accidents have hitherto
postponed his equipment, but he now has the command of
a fifty gun ship with some frigates, all under American
commissions and colors, fitted out at the King's expense,
and will sail, it is said, about the 1st of June.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette was, with some land troops,
to have gone with him, but I now understand the Marquis
is not to go, the plan being a little changed. The Alliance
being weakly manned at first, and the Captain judging it
necessary to be freed from thirtyeight of his men, who had
been concerned in a conspiracy, and unwilling to take
French seamen, I thought it best to send him directly
home, as his ship might be of some protection to the vessels
then about sailing to America, and Mr Adams, who
was desirous of returning soon, might be accommodated
with a passage in a swift sailing vessel. I accordingly
offered her as a convoy to the trade at Nantes, but the
gentlemen concerned did not think fit to wait for getting
ready, as a French convoy offered, for at least part of the
voyage, and the Minister requesting she might be added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Captain Jones's little squadron, and offering to give a passage
to Mr Adams in the frigate with the new Ambassador,
and to complete the Alliance's compliment of men,
I thought it best to continue her a little longer in Europe,
hoping she may, in the projected cruise, by her extraordinary
swiftness, be a means of taking prisoners enough to
redeem the rest of our countrymen, now in the English
gaols. With this view, as well as to oblige the Minister, I
ordered her to join Captain Jones at L'Orient, and obey
his orders, where she is now accordingly. There have
been great misunderstandings between the officers of that
ship and their Captain, and great discontents among the
men for want of clothes and money. I have been obliged
to make great advances to appease those discontents,
and I now hope the authority and prudence of Captain
Jones will be able to remove, or at least to prevent, the
ill effects of those misunderstandings. The conspirators
are detained in prison, and will remain there subject to
such directions as Congress may think fit to give concerning
them. The courts here would not, because they properly
could not, undertake to try them; and we had not
Captains enough to make a Court martial for the purpose.
The sending them to America, with evidence to convict
them, will be a great trouble and expense, and perhaps
their offence cannot be so clearly made out as to justify a
punishment sufficient to deter by its exemplary severity.
Possibly, the best use that can be made of them, is to give
them in exchange for as many Americans in the cartel
now operating here. The perfidious conduct of the English
and Scotch sailors in our service, a good deal discourages
the idea of taking them out of those prisons in order
to employ them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>This cartel is at length brought about by the indefatigable
endeavors of an old friend of mine, and a long declared
one to America, Mr Hartley, member of Parliament
for Hull. The ship employed has already brought us one
cargo from the prison at Plymouth. The number was intended
for a hundred, but proved ninetyseven, and she is
returned with as many in exchange, to bring us a second
number from the prison at Portsmouth. This is to continue
till all are exchanged. The Americans are chiefly
engaged with Captains Jones and Landais. This exchange
is the more remarkable, as our people were all
committed as for high treason.</p>

<p>Agreeable to the seventh instruction, I have earnestly
recommended the reduction of Halifax and Quebec. The
Marquis de Lafayette joined me warmly in the application
for this purpose, and I hope we shall in due time see some
good effects from it. I have also in various ways, and
through different channels, laid before the Ministry the
distressed state of our finances in America. There seems
a great willingness in all of them to help us, except in the
Controller, Monsieur Necker, who is said not to be well
disposed towards us, and is supposed to embarrass every
measure proposed to relieve us by grants of money. It is
certain, that under the resolution, perhaps too hastily declared,
of the King's imposing no new taxes on his subjects
for this year, the Court has great difficulties in
defraying present expense, the vast exertions to put the
navy in a condition to equal that of England having cost
immense sums.</p>

<p>There is also a prevailing opinion, that the most effectual
service to us is to be expected from rendering their
marine superior to that of England. The King has, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to encourage our loan in Holland, been so good as
to engage under his hand, to be security for our payment
of the interest of three millions of livres, but that
loan has not yet amounted to more than about eighty
thousand florins. Doctor Price, whose assistance was requested
by Congress, has declined that service, as you
will see by the copy of his letter enclosed. To me it
seems, that the measure recommended by the wisdom of
Congress, for diminishing the quantity of paper by taxes
of large nominal sums, must have very salutary effects.</p>

<p>As to your finances here, it is fit that you should know
the state of them. When the Commissioners of Congress
made the proposition of paying the interest at Paris
of the money borrowed in America, they understood the
loan to be of five millions of dollars. They obtained from
government sums more than sufficient for the interest of
such a sum. That sum has been increased, and if they
could otherwise have provided for it, they have been from
time to time drained by a number of unforeseen expenses,
of which the Congress had no knowledge, and of
others, occasioned by their orders and drafts; and the
cargoes sent to the Commissioners by the Committee
have some of them been treacherously run away with by
the seamen, or taken by the enemy, or, when arrived,
have been hitherto applied toward the payment of debts,
the tobaccos to the Farmers-General according to contract,
and the rice and indigo to Messrs Hortalez &amp; Co.
from whom, by the way, we have not yet been able to
procure any account.</p>

<p>I have lately employed an accountant, the son of our
banker, to form complete books of our accounts, to be
sent to Congress. They are not yet ready. When they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
are, I shall send them by the first safe opportunity. In
the meantime, I may just mention some particulars of our
disbursements. Great quantities of clothing, arms, ammunition,
and naval stores, sent from time to time; payment
of bills from Mr Bingham, one hundred thousand livres;
Congress bills in favor of Haywood &amp; Co. above two
hundred thousand; advanced to Mr Ross, about twenty
thousand pounds sterling; paid Congress drafts in favor
of returned officers, ninetythree thousand and eighty livres;
to our prisoners in England, and after their escape to
help them home, and to other Americans here in distress,
a great sum; I cannot at present say how much; supplies
to Mr Hodge for fitting out Captain Cunningham,
very considerable; for the freight of ships to carry over
the supplies, great sums; to Mr William Lee, and Mr
Izard, five thousand five hundred pounds sterling; and
for fitting the frigates Raleigh, Alfred, Boston, Providence,
Alliance, Ranger, &amp;c. I imagine not less than sixty or
seventy thousand livres each, taken one with another; and
for the maintenance of the English prisoners, I believe,
when I get in all the accounts, I shall find one hundred
thousand livres not sufficient, having already paid above
sixtyfive thousand on that article. And now the drafts of
the Treasurer of the loans, coming very fast upon me, the
anxiety I have suffered, and the distress of mind lest I
should not be able to pay them, has for a long time been
very great indeed.</p>

<p>To apply again to this Court for money for a particular
purpose, which they had already over and over again provided
for and furnished us, was extremely awkward; I
therefore repeated the <em>general</em> applications, which we had
made when together, for aids of money, and received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
general answers, that the expense of government for the
navy was so great, that at present it was exceedingly difficult
to furnish the necessary supplies. That France, by
sending a fleet to America, obliged the enemy to divide
their forces, and left them so weak on the continent, as to
aid us by lessening our expense, if it could not by giving
us money, &amp;c. &amp;c. and I was asked if we did not receive
money from Spain? I know indeed of some money received
from thence, and I have heard of more, but know
not how much, Mr Arthur Lee, as Minister for Spain,
having taken to himself all the management of that affair,
and will account to Congress. I only understand, that
there is none of it left to assist in paying Congress bills. I
at length obtained, as abovementioned, the King's <em>bon</em> for
payment of the interest of three millions, if I could borrow
it in Holland, or elsewhere, but though two eminent houses
in Amsterdam have undertaken it, and had hopes of success,
they have both lately written to me, that the great
demands of money for Germany and for England had
raised interest above our limits, and that the successes of
the English in Georgia and St Lucia, and in destroying
the French trade, with the supposed divisions in Congress,
all much magnified by the British Minister, and the pressing
application to borrow by several of our States separately,
had made the monied people doubtful of our stability,
as well as our ability to repay what might be lent us,
and that it was necessary to wait a more favorable moment
for proceeding with our loan.</p>

<p>In this situation, I have been applied to by Mr William
Lee, and lately through our banker, by Mr Izard, for more
money for their expenses, and I am told there is much
anger against me for declining to furnish them, and that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
am charged with <em>disobeying an order of Congress</em>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
with cruelly attempting to distress gentlemen, who are in
the service of their country. They have indeed produced
to me a resolve of Congress, <em>empowering them to draw</em> on
the Commissioners in France for their expenses at foreign
Courts; and doubtless Congress, when that resolve was
made, intended to enable us to pay those drafts; but as
that has not been done, and the gentlemen (except Mr
Lee for a few weeks) have not incurred any expense at
foreign Courts, and if they had, the five thousand five hundred
guineas, received by them in about nine months,
seemed an ample provision for it, and as both of them
might command money from England, I do not conceive
that I <em>disobeyed an order</em> of Congress, and that if I did,
the circumstances will excuse it; and I could have no intention
to distress them, because I must know it is out of
my power, as their private fortunes and credit will enable
them at all times to pay their own expenses.</p>

<p>In short, the dreadful consequence of ruin to our public
credit, both in America and Europe, that must attend
protesting a single Congress draft for interest after our
funds were out, would have weighed with me against the
payment of more money to those gentlemen, if the demand
had otherwise been well founded. I am, however, in the
judgment of Congress: and if I have done amiss, must
submit dutifully to their censure. Thanks to God, I have
this last week got over the difficulty, so far as relates to the
bills, which will all be punctually paid; but if the Navy
Board sends more ships here to be fitted, or the Congress
continue to draw for the payment of other debts, the ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
will be disappointed, and I shall probably be made a bankrupt,
unless funds are at the same time sent over to discharge
such demands.</p>

<p>With regard to the fitting out of ships, receiving and
disposing of cargoes, and purchasing of supplies, I beg
leave to mention, that besides my being wholly unacquainted
with such business, the distance I am from the
ports renders my having anything to do with it extremely
inconvenient. Commercial agents have indeed been appointed
by Mr William Lee, but they and the captains
are continually writing for my opinion or orders, or leave
to do this or that, by which much time is lost to them, and
much of mine taken up to little purpose, from my ignorance.
I see clearly, however, that many of the captains
are exorbitant in their demands, and in some cases I think
those demands are too easily complied with by the agents,
perhaps because the commissions are in proportion to the
expense. I wish, therefore, the Congress would appoint
the consuls they have a right to appoint by the treaty,
and put into their hands all that sort of employment. I
have in my desk, I suppose, not less than fifty applications
from different ports, praying the appointment, and offering
to serve gratis for the honor of it, and the advantage it
gives in trade; but I imagine that if consuls are appointed,
they will be of our own people from America,
who, if they should make fortunes abroad, might return
with them to their country.</p>

<p>The commissions demanded by the agents seem to me
in some cases very high. For instance, Mr Schweighauser,
in a late account, charges five per cent on the simple
delivery of the tobaccos to the officer of the Farmers-General
in the port, and by that means makes the commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on the delivery of the two last cargoes amount
to about six hundred and thirty pounds sterling. As
there was no sale in the case, he has, in order to calculate
the commission, valued the tobacco at ninety livres
the hundred weight, whereas it was, by our contract with
the Farmers, to be delivered at about forty livres. I got
a friend, who was going upon change, to inquire among the
merchants what was the custom in such cases of delivery.
I send enclosed the result he has given me of his inquiries.
In consequence, I have refused to pay the commission
of five per cent on this article; and I know not
why it was, as is said, agreed with him at the time of his
appointment, that he should have five per cent on his
transactions, if the custom is only two per cent, as by my
information.</p>

<p>I have mentioned above the applications of separate
States to borrow money in Europe, on which I beg leave
to remark, that when the General Congress are endeavoring
to obtain a loan, these separate attempts interfere,
and are extremely inconvenient, especially where some of
the agents are empowered to offer a higher interest, and
some have powers in that respect unlimited. We have
likewise lately had applications from three several States
to this Court, to be furnished with great quantities of
arms, ammunition, and clothing, or with money upon credit
to buy them; and from one State to be supplied with
naval stores and ships of war. These agents, finding that
they had not interest to obtain such grants, have severally
applied to me, and seem to think it my duty, as Minister
for the United States, to support and enforce their particular
demands. I have endeavored to do so, but I find the
Ministers do not like these separate applications, and seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to think that they should properly come only through Congress,
to whom the several States in such cases ought first
to make known their wants, and then the Congress could
instruct their Minister accordingly. This would save the
King's Ministers a good deal of trouble, and the several
States the expense of these particular agents; concerning
whom I would add a little remark, that we have in
America, too readily, in various instances, given faith to
the pretensions of strangers from Europe, and who offer
their services as persons who have powerful friends, and
great interest in their own country, and by that means obtain
contracts, orders, or commissions, to procure what
we want, and who, when they come here, are totally unknown,
and have no other credit but what such commissions
give them, or if known, the commissions do not add
so much to their credit as they diminish that of their
employers.</p>

<p>I have received two letters from a Frenchman, settled
in one of the ports of Barbary, offering himself to act as
our Minister with the Emperor, with whom he pretended
to be intimate, and acquainting me that his Imperial Majesty
wondered we had never sent to thank him for being
the first power on this side of the Atlantic that had acknowledged
our independence, and opened his ports to
us; advising that we should send the Emperor a present.
On inquiry at the office in whose department Africa is included,
I learnt the character of this man to be such, that
it was not safe to have any correspondence with him, and
therefore I did not answer his letters. I suppose Congress
has received the memorial we presented to this Court respecting
the Barbary States, and requesting the King's
good offices with them, agreeable to the treaty; and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the answer, expressing the King's readiness to perform
those good offices whenever the Congress should send us
instructions, and make provision for the necessary presents;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
or if those papers have not yet got to hand, they
will be found among the copies carried over by Mr Adams,
and therefore I only mention them by way of remembrance.
Whenever a treaty with the Emperor is intended,
I suppose some of our naval stores will be an acceptable
present, and the expectation of continued supplies
of such stores, a powerful motive for entering into and
continuing a friendship.</p>

<p>I should send you copies of several other memorials and
public papers; but as Mr Adams goes in the same ship,
and has the whole of our transactions during his time, it is
not so necessary by this vessel. The disposition of this
nation in general continues friendly towards us and our
cause, and I do not see the least diminution of it, except
among the West India merchants and planters, whose
losses have rendered them a little discontented. Spain
has been long acting as a mediator, but arming all the
time most vigorously. Her naval force is now very great
indeed, and as her last proposition of a long truce, in
which America should be included and treated as independent
in fact, though not expressly acknowledged as
such, has been lately rejected by England, it is now
thought, that her open junction with France in the war is
not far distant.</p>

<p>The Commissioners here have a power in general
terms to treat of peace, friendship, and commerce with
European States, but I apprehend this is scarce explicit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
enough to authorise me to treat of such a truce, if the
proposition should again come upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</i>. I therefore
wish the Congress to consider of it, and give such
powers as may be necessary to whom they may think
proper, that, if a favorable opportunity of making an advantageous
treaty should offer, it may not be missed.</p>

<p>Admiral Arbuthnot, who was going to America with a
large convoy and some troops, has been detained by a
little attempt upon Jersey; and contrary winds, since that
affair was over, have detained him further, till within these
few days.</p>

<p>Since I began writing this letter, I have received a
packet from the Committee, by way of Eustatia and Holland,
sent by Mr Lovell, containing his letters of December
the 8th, January the 29th, and February the 8th, with
one from the President, dated January the 3d. Several
papers are mentioned as sent with them, and by other opportunities,
but none are come to hand, except the resolution
to postpone the attempt on Canada, and these are the
first despatches received here since the date of those sent
by the Marquis de Lafayette. I have just received a letter
from Mr Bingham, acquainting me, that the ship Deane,
and the General Gates, are just arrived at Martinique, and
apply to him to be careened, refitted, and procure a fresh
supply of provisions; and that though he has no orders, he
must draw upon me for the expense. I think it right to
acquaint you thus early, that I shall be obliged to protest
his bills.</p>

<p>I have just obtained from his Majesty orders to the
government of Guadaloupe, to make reasonable reparation
to Captain Giddens of Newbury for the loss of his vessel,
sunk in mistake by a battery of that island. Great preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
are making here, with much activity in all the sea
ports, taking up transports, and building small vessels proper
for the landing of troops, &amp;c. so that many think an invasion
of England or Ireland is intended. The intention,
whatever it is, may change, but the opinion of such an intention,
which seems to prevail in England, may tend to
keep their troops and ships at home.</p>

<p>General and Lord Howe, Generals Cornwallis and
Grey, Colonel Montresor, and Captain Hammond, and
others, have formally given it as their opinion in Parliament,
that the conquest of America is impracticable.
This week, as we hear, John Maxwell, Joseph Galloway,
Andrew Allen, John Patterson, Theophilus Morris, Enoch
Story, and Jabez Fisher are to be examined to prove the
contrary. One would think the first set were likely to be
the best judges.</p>

<p>Be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the Congress,
and assure them of my most faithful services.</p>

<p class="close">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 2d, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received a few days since, via Eustatia and Holland,
the triplicates of your several favors, of December the 8th,
January the 29th, and February the 8th. The preceding
copies of the same dates never came to hand. I thank
you very much for the newspapers, though the disputes
I see in them give me pain. You observe rightly, that the
want of good conveyances obstructs much the punctuality
of your correspondence. The number of long letters I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
have written to America has almost discouraged me from
writing, except by such an opportunity as this. You may
judge of the uncertainty of letters getting to hand, when I
tell you, that though you mention the having sent me quadruplicates
of my credentials, only those by the Marquis de
Lafayette have yet appeared.</p>

<p>I am glad to understand, that you are taking measures
to restore the value of your money, by taxing largely
to reduce the quantity. I believe no financier in the world can
put you upon a more effectual method. The English have
had a little flow of spirits lately, from their success against
the trade of France, and the news of the imagined conquest
of Georgia, but the growing apprehension of a war
with Spain, also, begins to sober them, and, like people who
have been drunk with drams, they now seem to have both
the head and heart ache. The late letters from thence are
in a more humble style, and some printed papers by the
last post, known to be ministerial, appear intended to prepare
the minds of the people for propositions of peace.
But these ebbs and flows are common with them, and the
duration of neither is to be relied on.</p>

<p>As I do not find, by any of yours, that a long letter of
mine to you in July last, has come to hand, I send you herewith
a copy of it, (though now a little stale,) as it serves to
show my continued good opinion of a gentleman, who, by
the papers you have sent me, seems to be hardly used. I
have never meddled with the dispute between him and Mr
Lee, but the suspicion of having a good will to him has
drawn upon me a great deal of ill will from his antagonist.
The Congress have wisely enjoined the ministers in Europe
to agree with one another. I had always resolved to
have no quarrel, and have, therefore, made it a constant rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to answer no angry, affronting, or abusive letters, of which
I have received many, and long ones, from Mr Lee and
Mr Izard, who, I understand, and see indeed by the papers,
have been writing liberally, or rather illiberally, against
me, to prevent, as one of them says here, any impressions
my writings against them might occasion to their prejudice,
but I have never before mentioned them in any of my letters.</p>

<p>Our scheme here for packet boats did not continue.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I
wish Congress could fall on some method of sending some
little light vessels once a month, to keep up a correspondence
more regular. Even the receiving of letters of a
certain date, though otherwise of no importance, might serve
to refute the false news of our adversaries on both sides of
the water, which have sometimes too long their intended
effect before the truth arrives. I see that frequently little
pilot boats, of twentyfive or thirty tons burthen, arrive
safe from Virginia; the expense of such would not be
great.</p>

<p>I beg leave to recommend earnestly to your civilities
M. le Chevalier de la Luzerne, who goes over to succeed
M. Gerard, as the King's Minister to the Congress. He
bears here a most amiable character, has great connexions,
and is a hearty friend to the American cause.</p>

<p>With great esteem, I am, Sir, your most obedient and
most humble servant,</p>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, July 16th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>We find by the Minister of France, that your appointment
has given high satisfaction to his Court, and we are
encouraged to expect proofs of its most confidential reliance
upon your character. We have not had a line from
you of this year's date; indeed, I believe your latest is
November the 7th, 1778. Two days ago we received
several letters from Doctor Lee and one from Mr Izard;
the latter of March 4th, the former up to April 6th. The
vessel was from Rochelle about the middle of May.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that we did not get the information of
Mr Lee earlier, respecting the designs of the enemy against
Connecticut. They had accomplished a part of them a
few days before. Will no one under a commission from
these United States retaliate on the coast of England, for
the burning of our beautiful Fairfield. A single privateer
might, I think, show there a striking sample of the species
of war carried on by Britain against America. We are
told this evening, that General Lincoln has had an advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
over Prevost, in an open field fight, in which the militia
behaved to admiration, on the 20th of June.</p>

<p>We forward two letters for "our great, faithful, beloved
friend and ally, Louis Sixteenth, King of France and Navarre."
We submit, however, the superscription to your
judgment.</p>

<p>You will manage the invoices by your best abilities.
The probability of success was held out to us by one, who
doubtless makes known by this opportunity how much our
present circumstances render such aids essential to us. A
report of the treasury, respecting the just stipend of our
late and present Ministers at foreign Courts, is not quite
determined upon. A decision is peculiarly necessary as
to Mr Lee and Mr Izard, after the proceedings here of
June 8th. I put up for you a set of the Journals, which
have been printed this year, adding some spare numbers
to complete what have been sent in part of No. 15.</p>

<p>Presuming from report, and a passage of a letter from
Doctor Lee, that Mr Adams is on his return hither, we do
not write to him more. Should he remain in France, we
beg he may be made acquainted with the cause of our
omission. Good as this opportunity is, we expect a much

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS FROM CONGRESS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
In Congress, August 14th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>Having determined, in order to put a period to the present
war, conformably to the humane dispositions, which
sway the allied powers, that we would not insist on a direct
acknowledgment by Great Britain of our right in the fisheries,
this important matter is liable to an incertitude, which
may be dangerous to the political and commercial interests
of the United States; we have therefore agreed and resolved,
that our right should in no case be given up; that
we would not form any treaty of commerce with Great
Britain, nor carry on any trade or commerce whatsoever
with her, unless she shall make an express stipulation on
that subject; and that if she shall, after a treaty of peace,
disturb the inhabitants of these States in the exercise of it,
we will make it a common cause to obtain redress for the
parties injured.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the precautions, as Great Britain
may again light up the flames of war, and use our exercise
of the fisheries as her pretext; and since some doubts
may arise, whether this object is so effectually guarded by
the treaty of alliance with His Most Christian Majesty, that
any molestation therein on the part of Great Britain is to
be considered as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus federis</i>, you are to endeavor to
obtain of his Majesty an explanation on that subject upon
the principle, that notwithstanding the high confidence reposed
in his wisdom and justice, yet considering the uncertainty
of human affairs, and how doubts may be afterwards
raised in the breasts of his royal successors, the great importance
of the fisheries renders the citizens of these States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
very solicitous to obtain his Majesty's sense with relation
to them, as the best security against the ambition and rapacity
of the British Court. For this purpose, you will
propose the following article, in which nevertheless such
alterations may be made, as the circumstances and situation
of affairs shall render convenient and proper. Should
the same be agreed to and executed, you are immediately
to transmit a copy thereof to our Minister at the Court of
Spain.</p>

<p>Whereas by the treaty of alliance between the Most
Christian King and the United States of North America,
the two parties guaranty mutually from that time, and for
ever, against all other powers, to wit; the United States
to His Most Christian Majesty, the possessions then appertaining
to the crown of France in America, as well as
those which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace;
and His Most Christian Majesty guaranties, on his part, to
the United States, their liberty, sovereignty, and independence,
absolute and unlimited, as well in matters of government
as commerce, and also their possessions, and the
additions or conquests, that their confederation might obtain
during the war, according to the said treaty; and the said
parties did further agree and declare, that in case of a rupture
between France and England, the said reciprocal
guarantee should have its full force and effect, the moment
such war should break out; and whereas doubts may hereafter
arise how far the said guarantee extends to this case,
to wit; that Great Britain should molest or disturb the
subjects and inhabitants of France, or of the said States, in
taking fish on the banks of Newfoundland, and other the
fishing banks and seas of North America, formerly and
usually frequented by the subjects and inhabitants respectively;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and whereas the said king and the United States
have thought proper to determine with precision the true
intent and meaning of the said guarantee in this respect;</p>

<p>Now, therefore, as a further demonstration of their mutual
good will and affection, it is hereby agreed, concluded,
and determined as follows, to wit; that if, after the conclusion
of the treaty or treaties, which shall terminate the
present war, Great Britain shall molest or disturb the subjects
or inhabitants of the said United States in taking fish
on the banks, seas, and places formerly used and frequented
by them, so as not to encroach on the territorial
rights, which may remain to her after the termination of the
present war as aforesaid; and war should thereupon break
out between the said United States and Great Britain, or
if Great Britain shall molest or disturb the subjects and
inhabitants of France in taking fish on the banks, seas, and
places, formerly used and frequented by them, so as to encroach
on the territorial rights of Great Britain, as aforesaid,
and war should thereupon break out between France
and Great Britain, in either of those cases of war, as aforesaid,
His Most Christian Majesty and the said United
States shall make it a common cause, and aid each other
mutually with their good offices, their counsels, and their
forces, according to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes
good and faithful allies; provided always, that nothing
herein contained shall be taken or understood as contrary
to, or inconsistent with the true intent and meaning of
the treaties already subsisting between His Most Christian
Majesty and the said States; but the same shall be taken

Passy, August 24th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The Congress, sensible of your merit towards the
United States, but unable adequately to reward it, determined
to present you with a sword, as a small mark of
their grateful acknowledgment. They directed it to be
ornamented with suitable devices. Some of the principal
actions of the war, in which you distinguished yourself by
your bravery and conduct, are therefore represented upon
it. These, with a few emblematic figures, all admirably
well executed, make its principal value. By the help of
the exquisite artists France affords, I find it easy to express
everything but the sense we have of your worth,
and our obligations to you. For this, figures, and even
words, are found insufficient. I therefore only add, that,
with the most perfect esteem,</p>

<p class="close">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Havre, August 29th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Whatever expectations might have been raised from the
sense of past favors, the goodness of the United States for
me has ever been such, that on every occasion it far surpasses
any idea I could have conceived. A new proof of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that flattering truth, I find in the noble present which Congress
has been pleased to honor me with, and which is
offered in such a manner by your Excellency, as will exceed
anything but the feelings of my unbounded gratitude.</p>

<p>In some of the devices I cannot help finding too honorable
a reward for those slight services, which in concert with
my fellow soldiers, and under the godlike American hero's
orders, I had the good luck to render. The sight of these
actions, where I was a witness of American bravery and
patriotic spirit, I shall ever enjoy with that pleasure, which
becomes a heart glowing with love for the nation, and the
most ardent zeal for their glory and happiness. Assurances
of gratitude, which I beg leave to present to your Excellency,
are much too inadequate to my feelings, and nothing
but those sentiments may properly acknowledge your kindness
towards me. The polite manner in which Mr Franklin
was pleased to deliver that inestimable sword, lays me
under great obligations to him, and demands my particular
thanks.</p>

<p>With the most perfect respect, I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, September 30th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have within these few days received a number of
despatches from you, which have arrived by the Mercury
and other vessels. Hearing this instant of an opportunity
from Bordeaux, and that the courier sets out from
Versailles at five this evening, I embrace it just to let you
know, that I have delivered the letters from Congress to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the King, and have laid the invoices of supplies desired
(with a translation) before the Ministers, and though I
have not yet received a positive answer, I have good reason
to believe I shall obtain most of them, if not all.
But as this demand will cost the Court a vast sum, and
their expenses in the war are prodigious, I beg I may not
be put under the necessity, by occasional drafts on me,
of asking for more money than is required to pay our bills
for interest. I must protest those I have advice of from
Martinique and New Orleans, (even if they were drawn
by permission of Congress) for want of money; and I
wish the Committee of Commerce would caution their
correspondents not to embarrass me with their bills.</p>

<p>I put into my pocket nothing of the allowance Congress
has been pleased to make me. I shall pay it all
in honoring their drafts and supporting their credit, but
do not let me be burthened with supporting the credit of
every one, who has claims on the Board of Commerce
or the navy. I shall write fully by the Mercury.</p>

<p>I send you some of the latest newspapers, and have the

Passy, October 2d, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received your favor of the 17th past, and the two
samples of copper are since come to hand. The metal
seems to be very good, and the price reasonable, but I
have not yet received the orders necessary to justify my
making the purchase proposed. There has, indeed, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
an intention to strike copper coin, that may not only be
useful as small change, but serve other purposes. Instead
of repeating continually upon every half penny, the
dull story, that every body knows, and what it would have
been no loss to mankind if nobody had ever known, that
George the Third is King of Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, &amp;c. &amp;c. to put on one side some important proverb
of Solomon, some pious moral, some prudential or
economical precept, the frequent inculcation of which, by
seeing it every time one receives a piece of money, might
make an impression upon the mind, especially of young
persons, and tend to regulate their conduct; such as on
some, <em>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</em>;
on others, <em>Honesty is the best policy</em>; on others, <em>He that
by the plough would thrive, himself must either lead or
drive</em>; on others, <em>Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep
thee</em>; on others, <em>A penny saved is a penny got</em>; on others,
<em>He that buys what he has no need of, will soon be forced
to sell his necessaries</em>; on others, <em>Early to bed and early
to rise, will make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise</em>; and
so on, to a great variety.</p>

<p>The other side it was proposed to fill with good designs,
drawn and engraved by the best artists in France, of all
the different species of barbarity with which the English
have carried on the war in America, expressing every
abominable circumstance of their cruelty and inhumanity
that figures can express, to make an impression on the
minds of posterity, as strong and durable as that on the
copper. This resolution has been a long time forborne,
but the late burning of defenceless towns in Connecticut,
on the flimsy pretence that the people fired from behind
their houses, when it is known to have been premeditated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and ordered from England, will, probably, give the
finishing provocation, and may occasion a vast demand for
your metal. I thank you for your kind wishes respecting
my health. I return them most cordially fourfold into
your own bosom.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, October 4, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter your Excellency did me the honor
to write to me of the &mdash;&mdash; of June last, enclosing acts of
Congress, respecting bills of exchange for two millions four
hundred thousand livres tournois, drawn on me in favor of
M. de Beaumarchais. The bills have not yet appeared,
but I shall accept them when they do, relying on the care
of Congress to enable me to pay them. As to the accounts
of that gentleman, neither the Commissioners, when we
were all together, nor myself since, have ever been able to
obtain a sight of them, though repeatedly promised, and I
begin to give over all expectation of them. Indeed if I
had them, I should not be able to do much with them, or
to controvert anything I might doubt in them, being unacquainted
with the transactions and agreements on which
they must be founded, and having small skill in accounts.
Mr Ross and Mr Williams, pressing me to examine and
settle theirs, I have been obliged to request indifferent
persons, expert in such business, to do it for me, subject to
the revision of Congress; and I could wish that my time
and attention were not taken up by any concerns in mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
affairs, and thereby diverted from others more important.</p>

<p>The letters of Congress to the King were very graciously
received. I have earnestly pressed the supplies
desired, and the Ministers (who are extremely well disposed
towards us) are now actually studying the means of
furnishing them. The assistance of Spain is hoped for.
We expect to hear from thence in a few days. The quantity
is great, and will cost a vast sum. I have this day accepted
three of your drafts, part of the three hundred and
sixty thousand livres, drawn for on the 9th of June, but
when I ask for money to pay them, I must mention, that
as they were drawn to purchase military stores, an abatement
equal to the value may be made of the quantity demanded
from hence, for I am really ashamed to be always
worrying the Ministers for more money. And as to the
private loans expected, I wrote in a former letter, that our
public credit was not yet sufficiently established, and that
the loan in Holland had not exceeded eighty thousand
florins, to which there has since been no addition. A Mr
Neufville came from thence to me last spring, proposing to
procure great sums, if he might be employed for that purpose,
and the business taken away from the house that had
commenced it. His terms at first were very extravagant,
such as that all the estates real and personal in the Thirteen
Provinces should be mortgaged to him; that a fifth part of
the capital sum borrowed should every year, for five years,
be laid out in commodities, and sent to Holland, consigned
to him, to remain in his hands till the term (ten years)
stipulated for final payment was completed, as a security
for the punctuality of it, when he was to draw the usual
commissions; that all vessels or merchandise coming from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
America to Europe should be consigned to him or his
correspondents, &amp;c. &amp;c. As I rejected these with some
indignation, he came down to the more reasonable one of
doing the business as it was done by the other house, who,
he said, could do no more, being destitute of the interest
which he possessed.</p>

<p>I did not care abruptly to change a house, that had in
other respects been very friendly and serviceable to us, and
thereby throw a slur upon their credit, without a certainty
of mending our affairs by it, and therefore told Mr Neufville,
that if he could procure and show me a list of subscribers,
amounting to the sum he mentioned, or near it,
I would comply with his proposition. This he readily and
confidently undertook to do. But after three months,
during which he acquainted me from time to time, that the
favorable moment was not yet come, I received, instead of
the subscription, a new set of propositions, among the terms
of which were an additional <em>one per cent</em>, and a patent from
Congress, appointing him and his sons "<em>Commissioners for
Trade and Navigation, and Treasurers of the General
Congress and of every private State of the Thirteen United
States of North America, through the Seven United Provinces</em>,"
with other extravagancies, which I mention, that it
may be understood why I have dropped a correspondence
on this subject with a man, who seemed to me a vain
promiser, extremely self-interested, and aiming chiefly to
make an appearance without solidity, and who I understand
intends applying directly to Congress, some of his friends
censuring me as neglecting the public interest in not coming
into his measures.</p>

<p>The truth is, I have no expectations from Holland,
while interest received there from other nations is so high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and our credit there so low; while particular American
States offer higher interest than the Congress, and even our
offering to raise our interest tends to sink our credit. My
sole dependence now is upon this Court; I think reasonable
assistance may be obtained here, but I wish I may not
be obliged to fatigue it too much with my applications, lest
it should grow tired of the connexion.</p>

<p>Mr Ross has lately demanded of me near twenty thousand
pounds sterling, due to him from the Committee of
Commerce, but I have been obliged to refuse him, as well
as an application made last week by Mr Izard for more
money, though he has already had 2500 guineas, and
another from Mr Arthur Lee, though he has had five hundred
guineas since the news of his being out of this Commission.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
He writes me, that he will return to America
forthwith, if I do not undertake to supply his expenses.
As I see no likelihood of his being received at Madrid, I
could not but approve his resolution.</p>

<p>We had reason to expect some great events, from the
action of the fleets this summer in the Channel, but they
are all now in port, without having effected anything.
The junction was late, and the length of time the Brest
fleet was at sea, equal to an East India voyage, partly on
the hot Spanish coast, occasioned a sickness among the
people, that made their return necessary; they had chased
the English fleet, which refused combat. The sick men
are recovering fast since they were landed; and the proposed
descent on England does not yet seem to be quite
given up, as the troops are not withdrawn from the ports.</p>

<p>Holland has not yet granted the succors required by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
English, nor even given an answer to the requisition presented
by Sir Joseph Yorke. The aids will be refused;
and as the refusal must be disagreeable, it will be postponed
from time to time. The expectations of assistance
from Russia and Prussia seem also to have failed the
English, and they are as much at a loss to find effective
friends in Europe, as they have been in America.</p>

<p>Portugal seems to have a better disposition towards us
than heretofore. About thirty of our people, taken and
set ashore on one of her islands by the English, were
maintained comfortably by the Governor, during their stay
there, furnished with every necessary and sent to Lisbon,
where, on inquiry to whom payment was to be made for
the expense they had occasioned, they were told, that
no reimbursement was expected, that it was the Queen's
bounty, who had a pleasure in showing hospitality to strangers
in distress. I have presented thanks, by the Portuguese
Ambassador here in behalf of Congress, and I
am given to understand, that probably in a little time the
ports of that nation will be open to us, as well as those of
Spain. What relates to Spain, I suppose Mr Lee informs
you of.</p>

<p>The sword ordered by Congress for the Marquis de
Lafayette being at length finished, I sent it down to him
at Havre, where he was with the troops intended for the
invasion. I wrote a letter with it, and received an answer,
copies of which I enclose, together with a description of
the sword, and drawings of the work upon it, which was
executed by the best artists in Paris, and cost altogether
two hundred guineas. The present has given him great
pleasure, and some of the circumstances have been agreeable
to the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>Our cartel goes on, a second cargo of American prisoners,
one hundred and nineteen in number, being arrived
and exchanged. Our privateers have dismissed a great
number at sea, taking their written paroles to be given up
in exchange for so many of our people in their gaols.
This is not yet quite agreed to on the other side, but some
expectations are given me that it may take place. Certainly,
humanity would find its account in the practice of
exchanging on parole, as all the horrors of imprisonment,
with the loss of time and health, might be prevented by it.</p>

<p>We continue to insult the coasts of these <em>lords of the
ocean</em> with our little cruisers. A small cutter, which was
fitted out as a privateer at Dunkirk, called the Black
Prince, has taken, ransomed, burnt, and destroyed above
thirty sail of their vessels within these three months. The
owners are about to give her a consort, called the Black
Princess, for whom they ask a commission. The prisoners
brought in serve to exchange our countrymen,
which makes me more willing to encourage such armaments,
though they occasion a good deal of trouble. Captain,
now Commodore Jones, put to sea this summer with
a little squadron, consisting of a ship of forty guns, the
Alliance, another frigate of twenty, with some armed cutters;
all under American colors, with Congress commissions.
He has sent in several prizes, has greatly alarmed
the coast of Ireland and Scotland, and we just now hear
that going north about, he fell in with a number of ships
from the Baltic, convoyed by a fifty gun ship and a
twentyfour gun frigate, both of which he took after an
obstinate engagement, and forced several of the others
ashore. This news is believed, but we wait the confirmation
and the particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>The blank commissions remaining, of those sent to us
here, are all signed by Mr. Hancock, which occasions some
difficulty. If Congress approves of my continuing to issue
commissions, I wish to have a fresh supply, with the other
necessary instructions, rules, bonds, &amp;c. of which none are
now left.</p>

<p>M. le Comte de Mallebois, esteemed one of the best
Generals in this country, and who loves our cause, has
given me a memorial, containing a project for a corps here
for your service, which I promised to lay before Congress,
and accordingly enclose a copy. I know nothing of the
sentiments of Congress on the subject of introducing
foreign troops among us, and therefore could give no expectation
that the plan would be adopted. It will, however,
be a pleasure to him to know, that his good will to
serve them has been acceptable to the Congress.</p>

<p>A Major Borre, who has been in America, and some
other officers who have quitted our service in disgust, endeavor
to give an idea, that our nation does not love the
French. I take all occasions to place in view the regard
shown by Congress to good French officers, as a proof
that the slight these gentlemen complain of is particular to
themselves, and probably the effect of their own misbehavior.
I wish for the future, when any of this sort of
people leave our armies to come home, some little sketch
of their conduct or character may be sent me, with the
real causes of their resignation or departure, that I may be
the more able to justify our country.</p>

<p>Here are returned in the last cartel a number of French
sailors, who had engaged with Captain Cunningham.
Were taken in coming home in one of his prizes, and
have been near two years in English prisons. They demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
their wages and share of prize money. I send their
claim, as taken before the officers of the classes at Dunkirk.
I know nothing of the agreement which they allege
was made with them. Mr Hodge perhaps can settle the
affair, so that they may have justice done them. These
sort of things give me a great deal of trouble. Several of
those men have made personal applications to me, and I
must hear all their stories, though cannot redress them.
I enclose also the claim of two gunners, upon a prize
made by the Boston, Captain Tucker. I am persuaded
that Congress wish to see justice done to the meanest
stranger that has served them. It is justice that establishes
a nation.</p>

<p>The Spanish Ambassador here delivered me several
complaints against our cruisers. I imagine that all the injuries
complained of are not justly chargeable to us,
some of the smaller English cruisers having pillaged Spanish
vessels under American colors, of which we have proof
upon oath. And also, that no such American privateers,
as are said to have committed those robberies after coming
out of Nantes, have ever been known there, or in any
other part of France, or even to have existed. But if any
of the complaints are well founded, I have assured the
Ambassador that the guilty will be punished, and reparation
made.</p>

<p>The Swedish Ambassador also complains of the taking
of a ship of his nation by Captain Landais, the master of
which lays his damages at sixty thousand livres. I understand
it was his own fault that he was stopped, as he
did not show his papers. Perhaps this, if proved, may
enable us to avoid the damages.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have received the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
further particulars of the action between Commodore
Jones and the English men of war. The fortyfour gun
ship is new, having been but six months off the stocks;
she is called the Serapis; the other of twenty guns is the
Countess of Scarborough. He had before taken a number
of valuable prizes, particularly a rich ship bound to
Quebec, which we suppose he may have sent to America.
The English, from mistaken intelligence, imagining he had
a body of troops with him to make descents, have had all
their northern coasts alarmed, and have been put to very
expensive movements of troops, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The extravagant luxury of our country, in the midst of
all its distresses, is to me amazing. When the difficulties
are so great to find remittances to pay for the arms and
ammunition necessary for our defence, I am astonished
and vexed to find upon inquiry, that much the greatest
part of the Congress interest bills come to pay for tea,
and a great part of the remainder is ordered to be laid out
in gewgaws and superfluities. It makes me grudge the
trouble of examining, and entering, and accepting them,
which indeed takes a great deal of time.</p>

<p>I yesterday learnt from M. de Monthieu, that everything
necessary for equipping two frigates, of thirtysix guns
each, such as sailcloth, cordage, anchors, &amp;c. &amp;c. which
we sent to the Congress from hence two years since,
remains stored in the warehouses of his correspondent, Mr
Carrabass, at Cape Francois, having never been called for.
Probably by the miscarriage of letters, the Navy Board
never heard of those goods being there. I shall, nevertheless,
leave the application I have lately made for materials
for a frigate of thirtysix guns to take its course.
But I send you herewith copies of two invoices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
cargo of the Therese, one of which is what was sent by
us, the other by M. de Beaumarchais, to the end that
inquiry may be made after the whole.</p>

<p>On this occasion give me leave to remark, that of all
the vast quantities of goods we have sent you by many
different vessels since my being in France, we never
were happy enough to receive the least scrip of acknowledgment
that they had ever come to hand, except from
Mr Langdon, of a cargo arrived at Portsmouth, and I
think of one more. This is doubtless owing to the interruption
our correspondence has met with, and not altogether
to neglect. But as such advices of receipt may
be made in short letters, it would be well to send more
copies. The following is a matter of less importance.
It is two years, I believe, since I sent the monument of
General Montgomery. I have heard that the vessel
arrived in North Carolina, but nothing more. I should
be glad to know of its coming to hand, and whether it is
approved. Here it was admired for the goodness and
beauty of the marble, and the elegant simplicity of the
design. The sculptor has had an engraving made of it,
of which I enclose a copy. It was contrived to be
affixed to the wall within some church, or in the great
room where the Congress met. Directions for putting it
up went with it. All the parts were well packed in
strong cases.</p>

<p class="close">
With the greatest respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">B. FRANKLIN.
</p>

<p><em>P. S. October 28th.</em> I kept the packet in hopes of
sending a more explicit account of what might be expected
in regard to the supplies. The express, which was daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
expected from Spain, when I began this letter, arrived but
a few days since. I am now informed, that Court is understood
to be in treaty with the Congress in America, to
furnish a sum of hard money there, and on that account
excuses itself from sharing in the expense of furnishing
these supplies. This has a little deranged the measures
intended to be taken here, and I am now told, that the
whole quantity of goods demanded can hardly be furnished,
but that as soon as the Count returns from Marly, the Ministers
will consult and do the best they can for us. The
arms, I hear, are in hand at Charleville. I am unwilling
to keep the packet any longer, lest she should arrive on our
coasts too far in the winter, and be blown off. I therefore
send away the despatches; but if I have the result of the
Council in time to reach her by post, I will send it in a
separate letter. The hearty good will of the ministry may
be depended on; but it must be remembered, that their
present expenses are enormous.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, October 17th, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The foregoing is a copy of my last. I have now before
me your several favors therein mentioned, viz. of June
13th, July 9th and 16th, and August 6th. I received the
Journals of Congress from January 1st to June 12th,
which you took care to send me; but the volumes 1 and
2, which you mention, are not yet come to hand. I hear
they are at Madrid. I know not how they came there,
nor well how to get them from thence. Perhaps you
can easier send me another set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>As I hear of the arrival of the Chevalier de la Luzerne,
by whom I wrote a long letter to your Committee, I presume
you have received it, and that it is not necessary to
send more copies. By this opportunity I write largely to
the President. You ask, "will no one, under a commission
from the United States," &amp;c. Enclosed I send you
a copy of the instructions I gave to Commodore Jones,
when it was intended to send with him some transports
and troops to make descents in England.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Had not the
scheme been altered, by a general one of a grand invasion,
I know he would have endeavored to put some considerable
towns to a high ransom, or have burnt them. He
sailed without the troops, but he nevertheless would have
attempted Leith, and went into the Firth of Edinburgh with
that intention, but a sudden hard gale of wind forced him
out again. The late provocations, by the burning of Fairfield
and other towns, added to the preceding, have at
length demolished all my moderation, and were such another
expedition to be concerted, I think so much of that
disposition would not appear in the instructions. But I see
so many inconveniences in mixing the two nations together,
that I cannot encourage any further proposal of the kind.
This has ended better than I expected, and yet a mortal
difference has arisen between Captains Jones and Landais,
that makes me very uneasy about the consequences. I
send you the journal of the cruise.</p>

<p>I am glad to understand, that Congress will appoint some
person here to audit our accounts. Mine will give but
little trouble, and I wish much to have them settled. And
for the future, I hope I shall have none to settle but what
relate to my expenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>The quarrel you mention, between Mr Deane and Mr
Lee, I have never meddled with, and have no intention to
take any part in it whatever. I had and have still a very
good opinion of Mr Deane, for his zeal and activity in the
service of his country; I also thought him a man of integrity.
But if he has embezzled public money, or traded
with it on his private account, or employed it in stockjobbing,
all which I understand he is charged with, I give him
up. As yet, I think him innocent. But he and his accusers
are able to plead their own causes, and time will
show what we ought to think of them.</p>

<p>I send you with this, a piece written by a learned friend
of mine on the taxation of free States, which I imagine
may give you some pleasure. Also a late royal edict,
for abolishing the remains of slavery in this kingdom.
Who would have thought, a few years since, that we
should live to see a king of France giving freedom to
slaves, while a king of England is endeavoring to make
slaves of freemen.</p>

<p>There is much talk all over Europe of an approaching
peace by the mediation of Russia and Holland. I have
no information of it to be depended on, and believe we
ought to lay our account on another campaign, for which
I hope you will receive in time the supplies demanded.
Nothing is wanting on my part to forward them; and I
have the satisfaction to assure you, that I do not find the
regard of this Court for the Congress and its servants in
any respect diminished. We have just heard from Norway,
that two of the most valuable prizes taken by the
Alliance, Captain Landais, in the squadron of Commodore
Jones, are safe arrived at Bergen, viz. the ship from London
to Quebec, laden with naval stores, and that from Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to New York and Jamaica. They were letters of
marque, of twentytwo guns and eightyfour men each; I
wish we may get them safe to America. The squadron
itself is got into Holland, with the two prize men of war,
where they are all refitting. Great damage has been done
to the English coal trade, and four hundred prisoners have
been taken, which will more than redeem the rest of our
people from their captivity in England, if we can get them
safe from Holland to France; but I suppose the English
will endeavor to intercept us, and recover their ships, if
possible.</p>

<p>With great esteem for yourself and the Committee, I
have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO R. BERNSTORF, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN
DENMARK.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, December 22d, 1779.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received a letter from M. de Chezaulx, Consul
of France at Bergen in Norway, acquainting me that two
ships, viz. the Betsey and the Union, prizes taken from the
English on their coasts by Captain Landais, Commander
of the Alliance frigate, appertaining to the United States
of North America, which prizes having met with bad weather
at sea, that had damaged their rigging, and had occasioned
leaks, and been weakly manned, had taken shelter in the
supposed neutral port of Bergen, in order to repair their
damages, procure an additional number of sailors, and the
necessary refreshments; that they were in the said port
enjoying, as they conceived, the common rights of hospitality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
established and practised by civilized nations under
the care of the above said Consul, when, on the 28th of
October last, the said ships, with their cargoes and papers,
were suddenly seized by officers of his Majesty, the King
of Denmark, to whom the said port belongs; the American
officers and seamen turned out of their possession, and
the whole delivered to the English Consul.</p>

<p>M. de Chezaulx has also sent me the following as a
translation of his Majesty's order, by which the above proceedings
are said to be authorised, viz. "The English Minister
having insisted on the restitution of two vessels, which
had been taken by the American privateer called the Alliance,
commanded by Captain Landais, and which were
brought into Bergen, viz. the <em>Betsey</em> of Liverpool, and the
<em>Union</em> of London, his Majesty has granted this demand on
this account, because he has not as yet acknowledged the
independence of the Colonies associated against England,
and because that these vessels for this reason cannot be
considered as good and lawful prizes. Therefore, the said
two ships shall be immediately liberated and allowed to
depart with their cargoes." By a subsequent letter from
the same Consul, I am informed, that a third prize belonging
to the United States, viz. the <em>Charming Polly</em>, which
arrived at Bergen after the others, has also been seized
and delivered up in the same manner; and that all the
people of the three vessels, after being thus stripped of their
property, (for every one had an interest in the prizes) were
turned on shore to shift for themselves, without money, in
a strange place, no provision being made for their subsistence,
or for sending them back to their country.</p>

<p>Permit me, Sir, to observe on this occasion, that the United
States of America have no war but with the English;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they have never done any injury to other nations, particularly
none to the Danish nation; on the contrary, they are
in some degree its benefactors, as they have opened a
trade of which the English made a monopoly, and of
which the Danes may now have their share, and by dividing
the British Empire, have made it less dangerous to its
neighbors. They conceived, that every nation whom
they had not offended was by the rights of humanity their
friend; they confided in the hospitality of Denmark, and
thought themselves and their property safe when under the
roof of his Danish Majesty. But they find themselves
stripped of that property, and the same given up to their
enemies, on this principle only, that no acknowledgment
had yet been formally made by Denmark of the independence
of the United States; which is to say, that there is
no obligation of justice towards any nation with whom a
treaty, promising the same, has not been previously made.
This was indeed the doctrine of ancient barbarians, a doctrine
long since exploded, and which it would not be for
the honor of the present age to revive, and it is hoped, that
Denmark will not, by supporting and persisting in this decision,
obtained of his Majesty apparently by surprise, be
the first modern nation, that shall attempt to revive it.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>The United States oppressed by, and at war with one
of the most powerful nations of Europe, may well be supposed
incapable in their present infant state of exacting
justice from other nations not disposed to grant it; but it
is in human nature, that injuries as well as benefits received
in times of weakness and distress, national as well as personal,
make deep and lasting impressions; and those Ministers
are wise, who look into futurity and quench the first
sparks of misunderstanding between two nations, which,
neglected, may in time grow into a flame, all the consequences
whereof, no human prudence can foresee, which
may produce much mischief to both, and cannot possibly
produce any good to either. I beg leave, through your
Excellency, to submit these considerations to the wisdom
and justice of his Danish Majesty, who I infinitely respect,
and who, I hope, will reconsider and repeal the orders
above recited, and that, if the prizes which I hereby reclaim
in behalf of the United States of America, are
not actually gone to England, they may be stopped and
re-delivered to M. de Chezaulx, the Consul of France at
Bergen, in whose care they before were, with liberty to
depart for America when the season shall permit. But if
they should be already gone to England, I must then claim
from his Majesty's equity the value of the said prizes,
which is estimated at fifty thousand pounds sterling, but
which may be regulated by the best information that can
by any means be obtained.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, February 2d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>It is some time since I procured the discharge of your
Captain Stephenson. He did not call here in his way
home. I hope he arrived safely, and had a happy meeting
with his friends and family.</p>

<p>I have long postponed answering your letter of the 29th
of June. A principal point in it, on which you seemed to
desire my opinion, was, the conduct you thought America
ought to hold, in case her allies should, from motives of
ambition or resentment of former injuries, desire her to
continue the war, beyond what should be reasonable and
consistent with her particular interests. As often as I took
up your letter in order to answer it, this suggestion displeased
me, and I laid it down again. I saw no occasion
for discussing such a question at present, nor any
good end it could serve to discuss it before the case should
happen; and I saw inconveniences in discussing it. I
wish therefore you had not mentioned it. For the rest, I
am as much for peace as ever I was, and as heartily desirous
of seeing the war ended, as I was to prevent its
beginning; of which your Ministers know I gave a strong
proof before I left England, when, in order to an accommodation,
I offered at my own risk, without orders for so
doing, and without knowing whether I should be owned in
doing it, to pay the whole damage of destroying the tea at
Boston, provided the acts made against that Province were
repealed. This offer was refused. I still think it would
have been wise to have accepted it. If the Congress
have therefore intrusted to others rather than to me, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
negotiations for peace, when such shall be set on foot, as
has been reported, it is perhaps because they may have
heard of a very singular opinion of mine, that there hardly
ever existed such a thing as a bad peace, or a good war,
and that I might therefore easily be induced to make improper
concessions. But at the same time they and you
may be assured, that I should think the destruction of our
whole country, and the extirpation of our whole people,
preferable to the infamy of abandoning our allies.</p>

<p>As neither you nor I are at present authorised to treat
of peace, it seems to little purpose to make or consider
propositions relating to it. I have had so many such put
into my hands, that I am tired of them. I will however
give your proposal of a ten years' truce this answer, that,
though I think a solid peace made at once a much better
thing, yet, if the truce is practicable and the peace not, I
should be for agreeing to it. At least I see at present no
sufficient reasons for refusing it, provided our allies approve
of it. But this is merely a private opinion of mine,
which perhaps may be changed by reasons, that at present
do not offer themselves. This, however, I am clear in,
that withdrawing your troops will be best for you, if you
wish a cordial reconciliation, and that the truce should
produce a peace. To show that it was not done by compulsion,
being required as a condition of the truce, they
might be withdrawn beforehand, for various good reasons.
But all this is idle chat, as I am persuaded, that there is
no disposition for peace on your side, and that this war
will yet last many years. I know nothing and believe
nothing of any terms offered to Sir Henry Clinton.</p>

<p>The prisoners taken in the Serapis and Countess of
Scarborough being all treated for in Holland, and exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
there, I hope Mr Brown's son is now safe at
home with his father. It grieved me, that the exchange
there, which you may remember I immediately proposed,
was so long delayed. Much human misery might have
been prevented by a prompt compliance; and so might a
great deal by the execution of parole promises taken at
sea; but since I see no regard is paid to them in England,
I must give orders to our armed ships that cruise in Europe
to secure their prisoners as well as they can, and
lodge them in French or Spanish prisons. I have written
something on this affair to Mr Hodgson, and sent to him
the second passport for a cartel to Morlaix, supposing you
to be out of town. The number of prisoners we now
have in France is not easily ascertained. I suppose it
exceeds one hundred; yet you may be assured, that the
number which may be brought over by the two cartels
shall be fully exchanged, by adding to those taken by us as
many as will make up the compliment out of those taken
by the French, with whom we have an account since the
exchange in Holland of those we carried in there. I wish
therefore you would, as was proposed, clear your prisons
of the Americans, who have been so long confined there.
The cartels, that may arrive at Morlaix, will not be detained.</p>

<p>You may have heard, that accounts upon oath have
been taken in America, by order of Congress, of the British
barbarities committed there. It is expected of me to
make a school book of them, and to have thirtyfive prints
designed here by good artists, and engraved, each expressing
one or more of the different horrid facts, to be inserted
in the book, in order to impress the minds of children
and posterity with a deep sense of your bloody, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
insatiable malice and wickedness. Every kindness I hear
of, done by an Englishman to an American prisoner, makes
me resolve not to proceed in the work, hoping a reconciliation
may yet take place. But every fresh instance of
your devilism weakens that resolution, and makes me
abominate the thought of a reunion with such a people.
You, my friend, have often persuaded me, and I believed
it, that the war was not theirs, nor approved by them.
But their suffering it so long to continue, and the wretched
rulers to remain who carry it on, makes me think you
have too good an opinion of them.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>JAMES LOVELL TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, February 24th, 1780.
</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I forward the gazettes to Boston for you, as usual,
without knowing when they will find a passage from
thence. Your letters of September the 30th, and one
from Arthur Lee, of December the 8th, came to hand
two days ago, your prior being May the 26th, received
August the 17th. I hope you have got newspapers from
me often, though I have written few letters. The Commercial
Committee is impressed with your sentiments
respecting drafts. They are a mere name at present. I
hope that branch will, for a time, be conducted by the
Admiralty Board, till a new arrangement can be formed, to
be executed by persons not members of Congress. We
are about calling on the States according to their staples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
so that the prospect of suitable remittances is enlarged.
This plan is consequent upon a resolve of December the
14th.</p>

<p>I am, with great respect, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
JAMES LOVELL.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> The Chevalier de la Luzerne expressed to me
anxiety because we do not correspond in cypher. I early
communicated to you from Baltimore a very good one,
though a little tedious, like that of M. Dumas. I enclose
you a sample at this time.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>M. Gerard, under whose care I understand the despatches
from Congress to me were forwarded, is not yet
arrived here, and I have not received them. I cannot,
therefore, at present answer anything that may be contained
in them. He is, however, expected next week,
and I may afterwards have time to write further by the
Alliance. Mr Adams is come, but did not bring duplicates
of those despatches. I have, in obedience to the
order of Congress, which he produced to me, furnished
him with one thousand louis d'ors. I have also given a
credit to Mr Jay upon the correspondent of our banker at
Madrid for an equal sum. I have not yet heard of his
arrival there. His letter to me was from Cadiz, of the
28th of January.</p>

<p>In my last I gave some account of the success of our
little squadron under Commodore Jones. Three of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
prizes sent into Bergen, in Norway, were at the instance
of the British Minister seized by order of the Court of
Denmark, and delivered up to him. I have, with the
approbation of the Ministry here, drawn up and sent to
that Court a memorial reclaiming those prizes. It went
through the hands of the French Minister residing there,
who has delivered it; but I have yet no answer. I understand
from the French Consul at Bergen, that the
prizes remain still in that port, and it is said there is some
hope that the order may be reversed, but this is doubtful,
and I suppose the Congress will immediately consider this
important affair, and give me such instructions upon it as
they may judge proper. With this, I send a copy of the
memorial.</p>

<p>During the cruise a mortal quarrel took place between
the Commodore and Captain Landais. On their arrival
in Holland, M. de Sartine, Minister of the Marine, proposed
to me the sending for Landais, in order to inquire
into his conduct. I doubted the propriety of my meddling
in the affair, but Captain Landais' friends conceiving
it a measure that might be serviceable to him, and pressing
it, I complied, and he came accordingly to Paris. I send
the minutes of the inquiry for the consideration of Congress.
I have not presumed to condemn or acquit him,
doubting as well my own judgment as my authority. He
proposes to demand a Court Martial in America. In his
absence from the ship, the Commodore took the command
of her, and on quitting the Texel made a cruise through
the channel to Spain, and is since returned to the L'Orient,
where the ship is now refitting in order to return to America.
Captain Landais has not applied to me to be replaced
in her, and I imagine has no thought of that kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
having before on several occasions expressed to me and
others his dissatisfaction with his officers, and his inclination
on that account to quit her. Captain Jones will
therefore carry her home, unless he should be prevailed
with to enter another service, which, however, I think is
not likely, though he has gained immense reputation all
over Europe for his bravery.</p>

<p>As vessels of war under my care create me a vast
deal of business, of a kind too, that I am unexperienced
in, and by my distance from the coast is very difficult to
be well executed, I must repeat my earnest request, that
some person of skill in such affairs may be appointed in
the character of Consul, to take charge of them. I imagine
that much would by that means be saved in the
expense of their various refittings and supplies, which to
me appears enormous.</p>

<p>Agreeable to the order of Congress, I have employed
one of the best artists here in cutting the dies for the
medal intended for M. de Fleury. The price of such
work is beyond my expectation, being a thousand livres for
each die. I shall try if it is not possible to have the others
done cheaper.</p>

<p>Our exchange of prisoners has been for some time past
at a stand, the English admiralty refusing, after long consideration,
to give us any men in return for those who had
been dismissed by our armed vessels on parole, and the
actual prisoners we had being all exchanged. When the
squadron of Commodore Jones arrived in the Texel with
five hundred English prisoners; I proposed exchanging
there; but this was declined, in expectation, as I heard
from England, of retaking them in their way to France.
The stay of our ships in Holland, through the favor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
States, being prolonged, and the squadrons stationed to intercept
us being tired of cruising for us, the British Ministry
consented at length to a cartel with France, and
brought Frenchmen to Holland to exchange for those
prisoners instead of Americans. These proceedings have
occasioned our poor people to be kept longer in confinement,
but the Minister of the Marine, having given orders
that I should have as many English, another cartel
charged with Americans is now daily expected, and I
hope in a few months to see them all at liberty. This
for their sakes, and also to save expense; for their long
and hard imprisonment induces many to hazard attempts
of escaping, and those who get away through London and
Holland, and come to Paris in their way to some seaport
in France, cost one with another, I believe, near
twenty pounds sterling a head.</p>

<p>The delays in the exchange have I think been lengthened
by the Admiralty, partly with the view of breaking
the patience of our people, and inducing them to enter the
English service. They have spared no pains for this purpose,
and have prevailed with some. The number of
these has not indeed been great, and several of them lost
their lives in the blowing up of the Quebec. I am also
lately informed from London, that the flags of truce with
prisoners from Boston, one of which is seized as British
property, will obtain no Americans in exchange; the returned
English being told, that they had no authority or
right to make such agreements with rebels, &amp;c. This is
not the only instance in which it appears, that a few late
successes have given that nation another <em>hour of insolence</em>.
And yet their affairs, upon the whole wear a very unpromising
aspect. They have not yet been able to find any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
allies in Europe. Holland grows daily less and less disposed
to comply with their requisitions; Ireland is not satisfied,
but is making new demands; Scotland, and the
Protestants in England are uneasy, and the associations of
counties in England, with committees of correspondence
to make reforms in the government, all taken together,
give a good deal of apprehension at present, even to their
mad Ministers, while their debt, on the point of amounting
to the amazing sum of two hundred millions, hangs as
a millstone upon the neck of their credit, and must ere
long sink it beyond redemption.</p>

<p>The disposition of this Court continues as favorable
as ever, though it cannot comply with all our demands.
The supplies required, in the invoice sent me by the Committee,
appeared too great and numerous to be immediately
furnished. Three millions of livres were, however,
granted me, with which, after deducting what will be
necessary to pay the interest bills, and other late drafts of
Congress, I could not venture on ordering more than ten
thousand suits of clothes. With these, we shall have fifteen
thousand arms and accoutrements. A good deal
of the cloth goes over in the Alliance, purchased by Mr
Ross, which, it is computed, may make seven or eight
thousand suits more. But although we have not obtained
that invoice of goods, this Court being of immense expense
in the preparations for the next campaign, I have
reason to believe that a part of those preparations will be
employed in essential assistance to the United States, and
I hope effectual, though at present I cannot be more particular.</p>

<p>I have sent to Mr Johnson the vote of Congress relative
to the settlement of the accounts. He has expressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
readiness to enter on the service. Mr Deane is soon expected
here, whose presence is very necessary, and I hope
with his help they may be gone through without much
difficulty. I could have wished it had suited Mr Lee to
have been here at the same time.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, who, during his residence
in France, has been extremely zealous in supporting our
cause on all occasions, returns again to fight for it. He is
infinitely esteemed and beloved here, and I am persuaded
will do everything in his power to merit a continuance of
the same affection from America.</p>

<p>With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

Copenhagen, March 8th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Were you a person less known and respected, I should
have been quite at a loss on the subject of the letter, which
I have had the honor of receiving from you, which did not
come to hand till the 31st of January. I should have considered
it as a measure calculated to place us under a new
embarrassment as painful as the first; but there is no fear
nor risk with such a sage as you are, Sir, generally respected
by that universe, which you have enlightened, and
known for that prevailing love for truth, which characterises
the good man and the true philosopher. These are the
titles, which will transmit your name to the remotest posterity,
and in which I am particularly interested at the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
when the situation of affairs imposes on me the necessity
of divesting myself of every public character, in writing to
you, and only to aspire at appearing to you what I truly
am, the passionate friend of peace, truth, and merit.</p>

<p>This mode of thinking not only decides my personal sentiments
with respect to you, but also those I have respecting
the unfortunate affair, which you have thought fit to
mention to me, and which, from its commencement, has
given me the utmost pain. You will readily agree with
me, Sir, in granting that there are perplexing situations in
which it is impossible to avoid displeasing one party. You
are too equitable not to enter into ours. There would be
no consolation in such cases, nor would the persons who
have been led into them ever be forgiven, were it not
that opportunities sometimes present themselves of being
heard, and preventing in future such essential embarrassments.</p>

<p>The Baron de Blome will speak to you in confidence,
and with the utmost freedom on this subject, and if my
wishes can be accomplished I shall be recompensed for all
my pains, and there will only remain the agreeable recollection
of having had the satisfaction of assuring you, from
under my hand, of that superior and perfect esteem with
which I have the honor of being, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, our firm and constant friend,
returning to America, I have written a long letter by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to the President, of which a copy goes by this ship. M.
Gerard is since arrived, and I have received the despatches
you mentioned to me, but no letter in answer to
mine, a very long one, by the Chevalier de la Luzerne,
nor any acknowledgment that it came to hand.</p>

<p>By the many newspapers and pamphlets I send, you will
see the present state of European affairs in general. Ireland
continues to insist on complete liberty, and will probably
obtain it. The meetings of counties in England, and
the committees of correspondence they appoint, alarm a
good deal the Ministry, especially since it has been proposed
to elect out of each committee a few persons to assemble
in London, which, if carried into execution, will
form a kind of Congress, that will have more of the confidence
and support of the people than the old Parliament.
If the nation is not too corrupt, as I rather think it is, some
considerable reformation of internal abuses may be expected
from this. With regard to us, the only advantage
to be reasonably expected from it is a peace, the general
bent of the nation being for it.</p>

<p>The success of Admiral Rodney's fleet against our allies
has a little elated our enemies for the present, and probably
they will not now think of proposing it. If the
approaching campaign, for which great preparations are
making here, should end disadvantageously to them, they
will be more treatable, for their debts and taxes are daily
becoming more burthensome, while their commerce, the
source of their wealth, diminishes, and though they have
flattered themselves with obtaining assistance from Russia
and other powers, it does not appear they are likely to
succeed; on the contrary, they are in danger of losing
the neutrality of Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Their conduct with regard to the exchange of prisoners
has been very unjust. After long suspense and affected
delays for the purpose of wearing out our poor people,
they have finally refused to deliver us a man in exchange
for those set at liberty by our cruisers on parole. A letter,
which I enclose from Captain Mitchell, will show the treatment
of the late flags of truce from Boston. There is no
gaining anything from these barbarians by advances of
civility or humanity.</p>

<p>Enclosed I send for Congress the justification of this
Court against the accusation published in the late English
memorials.</p>

<h3>TO JOSEPH REED, PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF
PENNSYLVANIA.</h3>

<p class="signature">
Passy. March 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received the pamphlet you did me the honor
to send me by M. Gerard, and have read it with pleasure.
Not only as the clear state of facts it does you honor, but as
it proves the falsehood of a man, who also showed no regard
to truth in what he said of me, "<em>that I approved of the
propositions he carried over</em>." The truth is this. His
brother, Mr. Pultney, came here with those propositions; and
after stipulating, that if I did not approve of them, I should
not speak of them to any person, he communicated them to
me. I told him frankly, on his desiring to know my sentiments,
that I <small>DID NOT</small> <em>approve of them, and that I was
sure they</em> <small>WOULD NOT</small> <em>be accepted in America</em>. But, I said,
there are two other Commissioners here; I will, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
please, show your propositions to them, and you will hear
their opinions. I will also show them to the ministry here,
without whose knowledge and concurrence we can take no
step in such affairs. No, said he, as you do not approve
of them, it can answer no purpose to show them to anybody
else; the reasons that weigh with you will also weigh
with them; therefore I now pray that no mention may be
made of my having been here, or my business. To this
I agreed, and therefore nothing could be more astonishing
to me, than to see in an American newspaper, that direct
lie, in a letter from Mr Johnstone, joined with two other
falsehoods relating to the time of the treaty, and to the
opinion of Spain!</p>

<p>In proof of the above I enclose a certificate of a friend
of Mr Pultney's, the only person present at our interview;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and I do it the rather at this time, because I am informed
that another calumniator (the same who formerly in his
private letters to particular members accused you, with
Messrs Jay, Duane, Langdon, and Harrison, of betraying
the secrets of Congress in a correspondence with the ministry)
has made this transition with Mr Pultney an article
of accusation against me, as having approved the same
propositions. He proposes, I understand, to settle in your
government. I caution you to beware of him; for in
sowing suspicions and jealousies, in creating misunderstandings
and quarrels among friends, in malice, subtility, and
indefatigable industry, he has I think no equal.</p>

<p>I am glad to see that you continue to preside in our new
State, as it shows that your public conduct is approved by
the people. You have had a difficult time, which required
abundance of prudence, and you have been equal to the
occasion. The disputes about the Constitution seem to
have subsided. It is much admired here, and all over
Europe, and will draw over many families of fortune to
settle under it, as soon as there is a peace. The defects
that may on seven years' trial be found in it can be amended,
when the time comes for considering them.</p>

<p>With great and sincere esteem and respect I have the
honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE JUDGES OF THE ADMIRALTY AT CHERBOURG.</h3>

<p class="signature">
Passy, May 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>I have received the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procés verbaux</i>, and other papers
you did me the honor to send me, agreeable to the 11th
article of the regulation of the 27th of September, 1778.
These pieces relate to the taking of the ship Flora,
whereof was Captain Henry Roodenberg, bound from
Rotterdam to Dublin, and arrived at Cherbourg, in
France, being taken the 7th day of April, by Captain
Dowlin, commander of the American privateer the Black
Prince.</p>

<p>It appears to me from the above mentioned papers, that
the said ship Flora is not a good prize, the same belonging
to the subjects of a neutral nation; but that the cargo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is really the property of the subjects of the King of England,
though attempted to be masked as neutral. I do
therefore request, that after the cargo shall be landed, you
would cause the said ship Flora to be immediately restored
to her captain, and that you would oblige the captors
to pay him his full freight according to his bills of
lading, and also to make good all the damages he may have
sustained by plunder or otherwise; and I further request,
that as the cargo is perishable, you would cause it to be
sold immediately, and retain the produce deposited in your
hands, to the end, that if any of the freighters, being subjects
of their High Mightinesses the States-Generals, will
declare upon oath, that certain parts of the said cargo were
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> shipped on their own account and risk, and not
on the account and risk of any British or Irish subjects, the
value of such parts may be restored; or, that if the
freighters, or any of them, should think fit to appeal from
this judgment to the Congress, the produce so deposited
may be disposed of according to their final determination.</p>

<p>The Baron d'Arendt, Colonel in the armies of the United

the service in America, though not entirely cured of his
wound, which occasioned his voyage to Europe, I endeavored
to dissuade him from the undertaking. But he

<p class="head">
Passy, May 30th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In my last, of the 27th instant, I omitted one thing I
had intended, viz. to desire you would give absolute
orders to your cruisers not to bring in any more Dutch
vessels, though charged with enemy's goods, unless contraband.
All the neutral States of Europe seem at present
disposed to change what had before been deemed the law
of nations, to wit; that an enemy's property may be taken
wherever found; and to establish a rule that free ships
shall make free goods. This rule is itself so reasonable,
and of a nature to be so beneficial to mankind, that I cannot
but wish it may become general. And I make no
doubt but that the Congress will agree to it, in as full an
extent as France and Spain. In the meantime, and until
I have received their orders on the subject, it is my intention
to condemn no more English goods found in Dutch
vessels, unless contraband; of which I thought it right to
give you this previous notice, that you may avoid the
trouble and expense likely to arise from such captures,
and from the detention of them for a decision. With
great regard, and best wishes for the success of your enterprise,</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 31st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I wrote to your Excellency the 4th of March past, to
go by this ship, the Alliance, then expected to sail immediately.
But the men refusing to go till paid their
shares of prize money, and sundry difficulties arising with
regard to the sale and division, she has been detained thus
long to my great mortification, and I am yet uncertain
when I shall be able to get her out. The trouble and
vexation which these maritime affairs give me is inconceivable.
I have often expressed to Congress my wish
to be relieved from them, and that some person better
acquainted with them, and better situated, might be appointed
to manage them; much money as well as time
would, I am sure, be saved by such an appointment.</p>

<p>The Alliance is to carry some of the cannon long since
ordered and as much of the powder, arms and clothing,
(furnished by government here) as she, together with a
frigate, the Ariel, we have borrowed, can take. I hope
they may between them take the whole, with what has
been provided by Mr Ross. This gentleman has, by
what I can learn served the Congress well in the quality
and prices of the goods he has purchased. I wish it had
been in my power to discharge his balance here, for which
he has importuned me rather too much. We furnished
him with about twenty thousand pounds sterling to discharge
his first accounts, which he was to replace as soon
as he received remittance from the Committee of Commerce.
This has not been done, and he now demands
another nearly equal sum, urging as before, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
credit of the States as well as his own will be hurt by
my refusal.</p>

<p>Mr Bingham too complains of me for refusing some of
his drafts, as very hurtful to his credit, though he owns he
had no orders from Congress to authorise those drafts. I
never undertook to provide for more than the payment of
the interest bills of the first loan. The Congress have
drawn on me very considerably for other purposes, which
has sometimes greatly embarrassed me, but I have duly
accepted and found means to pay their drafts; so that
their credit in Europe has been well supported. But if
every agent of Congress in different parts of the world is
permitted to run in debt, and draw upon me at pleasure to
support his credit, under the idea of its being necessary to
do so for the honor of Congress, the difficulty upon me
will be too great, and I may in fine be obliged to protest
the interest bills. I therefore beg that a stop may be put
to such irregular proceedings.</p>

<p>Had the loans proposed to be made in Europe succeeded,
these practices might not have been so inconvenient,
but the number of agents from separate States running
all over Europe, and asking to borrow money, has
given such an idea of our distress and poverty as makes
every body afraid to trust us. I am much pleased to find
that Congress has at length resolved to borrow of our own
people, by making then future bills bear interest. This
interest duly paid in hard money, to such as require hard
money, will fix the value of the principal, and even make
the payment of the interest in hard money for the most
part unnecessary, provided always that the quantity of principal
be not excessive.</p>

<p>A great clamor has lately been made here by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
merchants, who say they have large sums in their hands
of paper money in America, and that they are ruined
by some resolution of Congress, which reduces its value to
one part in forty. As I have had no letter explaining
this matter, I have only been able to say, that it is probably
misunderstood, and that I am confident the Congress
have not done, nor will do, anything unjust towards strangers,
who have given us credit. I have indeed been almost
ready to complain, that I hear so little and so seldom from
Congress, or from the Committee of Correspondence, but
I know the difficulty of communication, and the frequent
interruption it meets in this time of war. I have not yet
received a line this year, and the letters written by the
Confederacy, as I suppose some must have been written
by her, have not yet come to hand.</p>

<p>I mentioned, in a former letter, my having communicated
to Mr Johnson of Nantes, the order of Congress
appointing him to examine the account, and his acceptance
of that appointment. Nothing, however, has yet been
done in pursuance of it; for Mr Deane having written that
he might be expected here by the middle of March, and
as his presence would be very useful in explaining the
mercantile transactions, I have waited his arrival to request
Mr Johnson's coming to Paris, that his detention
here from his affairs at Nantes might be as short as possible.
Mr Deane is not yet come; but as we have heard
of the arrival of the Fendant in Martinique, in which ship
he took his passage, we imagine he may be here in some
of the first ships from that island.</p>

<p>The medal for M. de Fleury is done and delivered to
his order, he being absent; I shall get the others prepared
as soon as possible by the same hand, if I cannot find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
cheaper equally good, which I am now inquiring after.
Two thousand livres appear to me a great sum for the
work.</p>

<p>With my last I sent a copy of my memorial to the Court
of Denmark. I have since received an answer from the
Minister of that Court for Foreign Affairs, a copy of which
I enclose. It referred me to the Danish Minister here,
with whom I have had a conference on the subject. He
was full of professions of the good will of his Court to the
United States, and would excuse the delivery of our prizes
to the English, as done in conformity to treaties, which it
was necessary to observe. He had not the treaty to show
me, and I have not been able to find such a treaty on
inquiry. After my memorial, our people left at Bergen
were treated with the greatest kindness by an order from
Court, their expenses during the winter that they had
been detained there all paid, necessaries furnished to
them for their voyage to Dunkirk, and a passage thither
found for them all at the King's expense. I have not
dropped the application for a restitution, but shall continue
to push it, not without some hopes of success. I wish,
however, to receive instructions relating to it, and I think
a letter from Congress to that Court might forward the
business; for I believe they are sensible they have done
wrong, and are apprehensive of the inconveniences that
may follow. With this I send the protests taken at Bergen
against the proceeding.</p>

<p>The Alliance, in her last cruise, met with and sent to
America a Dutch ship, supposed to have on board an
English cargo. The owners have made application to
me. I have assured them, that they might depend on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
justice of our courts, and that if they could prove their
property there, it would be restored. M. Dumas has written
to me about it. I enclose his letter, and wish despatch
may be given to the business, as well to prevent the inconveniences
of a misunderstanding with Holland, as for
the sake of justice.</p>

<p>A ship of that nation has been brought in here by the
Black Prince, having an English cargo. I consulted with
Messrs Adams and Dana, who informed me that it was an
established rule with us in such cases to confiscate the
cargo, but to release the ship, paying her freight, &amp;c.
This I have accordingly ordered in the case of this ship,
and hope it may be satisfactory. But it is a critical time
with respect to such cases, for whatever may formerly have
been the law of nations, all the neutral powers at the instance
of Russia seem at present disposed to change it,
and to enforce the rule that <em>free ships shall make free
goods</em>, except in the case of contraband. Denmark, Sweden,
and Holland, have already acceded to the proposition,
and Portugal is expected to follow. France and
Spain, in their answers, have also expressed their approbation
of it. I have, therefore, instructed our privateers
to bring in no more neutral ships, as such prizes occasion
much litigation, and create ill blood.</p>

<p>The Alliance, Captain Landais, took two Swedes in
coming hither, who demand of us for damages, one, upward
of sixty thousand livres, and the other near five hundred
pounds sterling; and I cannot well see how the demand
is to be settled. In the newspapers that I send, the
Congress will see authentic pieces expressing the sense
of the European powers on the subject of neutral navigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
I hope to receive the sense of Congress for my future government,
and for the satisfaction of the neutral nations now
entering into the confederacy, which is considered here as
a great stroke against England.</p>

<p>In truth, that country seems to have no friends on this
side of the water; no other nation wishes it success in its
present war, but rather desires to see it effectually humbled;
no one, not even their old friends the Dutch, will
afford them any assistance. Such is the mischievous effect
of pride, insolence, and injustice on the affairs of nations,
as well as on those of private persons!</p>

<p>The English party in Holland is daily diminishing, and
the States are arming vigorously to maintain the freedom
of their navigation. The consequence may possibly be a
war with England, or a serious disposition in that mad
nation to save what they can by a timely peace.</p>

<p>Our cartel for the exchange of American prisoners has
been some time at a stand. When our little squadron
brought near five hundred into Holland, England would
not at first exchange Americans for them there, expecting
to take them in their passage to France. But at
length an agreement was made between the English and
French ambassadors, and I was persuaded to give them
up, on a promise of having an equal number of English
delivered to my order at Morlaix. So those were exchanged
for Frenchmen. But the English now refuse to
take any English in exchange for Americans, that have not
been taken by American cruisers. They also refuse to
send me any Americans in exchange for their prisoners
released, and sent home by the two flags of truce from
Boston. Thus they give up all pretensions to equity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
honor, and govern themselves by caprice, passion, and
transient views of present interest.</p>

<p>Be pleased to present my duty to Congress, and believe
me to be with great respect, your Excellency's, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="head">
Passy June 5th, 1780</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The gentleman whose name you wished to know, in one
of your late letters, is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Westhuysen, Echevin et Conseiller
de la Ville de Harlem</i>. I shall probably send an order to
that place for some of the types, of which you have sent me
the prices, <em>before I leave Europe</em>. I think them very good
and not dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>A Dutch ship belonging to Messrs Little, Dale, &amp; Co.
of Rotterdam, being brought into France as having an English
cargo on board, I have followed your opinion with
regard to the condemnation of the cargo, which I think the
more right, as the English have in the West Indies confiscated
several of our cargoes found in Dutch ships. But
to show respect to the declaration of the Empress of Russia,
I have written to the owners of our privateers, a letter of
which I enclose a copy, together with a copy of the judgment,
for your use, if you hear of any complaint. I approve
much of the principles of the confederacy of the
neutral powers, and am not only for respecting the ships as
the house of a friend, though containing the goods of an
enemy, but I even wish for the sake of humanity, that the
law of nations may be further improved, by determining,
that even in time of war, all those kinds of people who are
employed in procuring subsistence for the species, or in
exchanging the necessaries or conveniences of life, which
are for the common benefit of mankind, such as husbandmen
on their lands, fishermen in their barques, and traders
in unarmed vessels, shall be permitted to prosecute their
several innocent and useful employments without interruption
or molestation, and nothing taken from them, even
when wanted by an enemy, but on paying a fair price for
the same.</p>

<p>I think you have done well to print the letter of Clinton,
for though I have myself had suspicions whether some
parts of it were really written by him, yet I have no doubt
of the facts stated, and think the piece valuable, as giving
a true account of the state of British and American affairs
in that quarter. On the whole, it has the appearance of a
letter written by a general, who did not approve of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
expedition he was sent upon, who had no opinion of the
judgment of those who drew up his instructions, who had
observed, that the preceding commanders, Gage, Burgoyne,
Keppel, and the Howes, had all been censured by the Ministers
for having unsuccessfully attempted to execute injudicious
instructions with unequal force, and he therefore
wrote such a letter, not merely to give the information contained
in it, but to be produced in his vindication, when
he might be recalled, and his want of success charged
upon him as a crime; though, in truth, owing to the folly
of the Ministers, who had ordered him on impracticable
projects, and persisted in them, notwithstanding his faithful
informations, without furnishing the necessary number of
troops he had demanded. In this view much of the letter
may be accounted for, without supposing it fictitious; and
therefore if not genuine, it is ingeniously written. But
you will easily conceive, that if the state of public facts it
contains were known in America to be false, such a publication
there would have been absurd, and of no possible
use to the cause of the country.</p>

<p>I have written to M. Neufville concerning the bills you
mention: I have no orders or advice about them, know
nothing of them, and therefore cannot prudently meddle
with them; especially as the funds in my power are not
more than sufficient to answer the Congress bills for interest
and other inevitable demands. He desired to know
whether I would engage to reimburse him, if he should
accept and pay them; but as I know not the amount of
them, I cannot enter into any such engagement; for
though, if they are genuine Congress bills, I am persuaded
all possible care will be taken by Congress to provide for
their punctual payment, yet there are so many accidents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by which remittances are delayed or intercepted in the
time of war, that I dare not hazard for these new bills the
possibility of being rendered unable to pay the others.</p>

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Versailles, June 30th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I did not until this day receive the letter, which you did
me the honor to write to me on the 24th of this month.</p>

<p>You request, in consequence of an application made to
you by Mr Adams, that the orders given to the Chevalier
de la Luzerne relative to a resolution of Congress of the
18th of March last should be revoked, or at least suspended,
as that Plenipotentiary is able to prove, that those
orders are founded on false reports.</p>

<p>Mr Adams on the 22d sent me a long dissertation on
the subject in question, but it contains only abstract reasonings,
hypothesis, and calculations, which have no real
foundation, or which at least do not apply to the subjects
of the King, and in fine principles, than which nothing can
be less analogous to the alliance subsisting between his
Majesty and the United States.</p>

<p>By this, Sir, you can judge that the pretended proofs
mentioned by Mr Adams are not of a nature to induce us
to change our opinion, and consequently cannot effect a
revocation or suspension of the orders given to the Chevalier
de la Luzerne. The King is so firmly persuaded,
Sir, that your private opinion respecting the effects of that
resolution of Congress as far as it concerns strangers, and
especially Frenchmen, differs from that of Mr Adams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that he is not apprehensive of laying you under any embarrassments
by requesting you to support the representations,
which his Minister is ordered to make to Congress.
And that you may be enabled to do this with a complete
knowledge of the case, his Majesty has commanded me
to send you a copy of my letter to Mr Adams, the observations
of that Plenipotentiary, and my answer to him.</p>

<p>The King expects that you will lay the whole before
Congress, and his Majesty flatters himself that that assembly,
inspired with principles different from those which
Mr Adams has discovered, will convince his Majesty, that
they know how to prize those marks of favor, which the
King has constantly shown to the United States.</p>

<p>However, Sir, the King does not undertake to point
out to Congress the means which may be employed to indemnify
the French, who are holders of the paper money.
His Majesty, with respect to that, relies entirely on the
justice and wisdom of that assembly.</p>

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

taken this step with reluctance; but the present crisis,
when not only the preparations for a vigorous campaign

<h3>COMMITTEE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO H. DOHRMAN, MERCHANT,
LISBON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, July 11th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Mr George Anderson, of Virginia, having informed us of
the humane and benevolent attention uniformly given by
you to the citizens of these States, who have been so unfortunate
as to be captivated at sea and carried into the
ports of Portugal, we represented the same to Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to whom it gave much pleasure to know, that those men
had found a patron and friend disposed to alleviate their
distresses.</p>

<p>The enclosed Resolve constitutes you an Agent of
Congress, and you will, from time to time, receive powers
and instructions from that body through this Committee.
At present we need only say in general, that the affairs of
the citizens of America, applying for relief in captivity, are
committed to your discretion, and your countenance and
advice in matters of business are solicited for others.</p>

<p>We wish to learn from you in what manner you would
be repaid, trusting that though the war in which this republic
is engaged oppresses it with expense, and calls now
for all its resources, you will by no means fail in the end
of compensation.</p>

<p>You must be governed in your advances on account of
these United States more by that economy, which their
circumstances make essential, than by the liberality of your
own habits, which American subjects in distress will probably
but too often stimulate. You ought to know that
Doctor Franklin and others, who have advanced monies
to Americans under the misfortune of captivity, have transmitted
receipts regularly, so that due charges may be made
against those who are in public service, and repayment
may be had of those who are in condition to make it while
in private employ.</p>

<p>You will correspond with our Ministers and Agents in
France, Spain, and Holland, whenever you may thereby
promote the interests of these United States, for which you
have manifested already so much regard.</p>

We are, Sir, your most humble servants,</p>

<p>Enclosed I send you a copy of a conciliatory bill,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which
was proposed in the House of Commons on the 27th of

much intercourse upon the subject of restoring peace between
Great Britain and America, that I think there is
nothing further left to be said upon the subject. You will
perceive by the general tenor of the bill, that it proposes a
general power to treat. It chalks out a line of negotiation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in very general terms. I remain in the sentiments which
I ever have, and which I believe I ever shall entertain, viz.
those of seeking peace upon honorable terms. I shall
always be ready, and most desirous to join in any measures
which may facilitate peace.</p>

<h3>TO C. W. F. DUMAS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I wrote to Messrs de Neufville by the last post, in
answer to theirs of the 14th. I hope they received my
letter. It signified, that I could accept the bills drawn on
Mr Laurens. I find by a vote of Congress on the 4th of
March, that they then stopped drawing, and I am informed
no more bills have been issued since. I could not
relish those gentlemen's proposal of mortgaging <em>all our
estates</em>, for the little money Holland is likely to lend us.
But I am obliged to them for their zeal in our cause.</p>

<p>I received, and thank you for the protest relating to the
election of the coadjutor. You seem to be too much
affected with the taking of Charleston. It is so far a
damage to us, as it will enable the enemy to exchange a
great part of the prisoners we had in our hands, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
their affairs will not be much advanced by it. They have
successively been in possession of the capitals of five provinces,
viz. Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,
New York, and Georgia; but were not therefore in
possession of the provinces themselves. New York and
Georgia still continue their operations as free States; and
so I suppose will South Carolina. The cannon will be recovered
with the place; if not, our furnaces are constantly
at work in making more. The destroying of our ships by
the English, is only like shaving our beards, which will
grow again. Their loss of provinces is like the loss of a
limb, which can never again be united to their body. I
was sorry to hear of your indisposition. Take care of
yourself. Honey is a good thing for obstructions in the
reins. I hope your health is by this time re-established.</p>

<p>I am less committed than you imagine in the affair between
Jones and Landais. The latter was not dispossessed
by me of his command, but quitted it. He afterwards
took it into his head to resume it, which the
former's too long stay at Paris gave him an opportunity
of effecting. Captain Jones is going in the Ariel frigate
to America, where they may settle their affairs as they
can.</p>

<p>The captain commandant of Dunkirk, who occasioned
the loss of our despatches, is himself taken by the English.
I have no doubt of the truth of what Mr White
told you about the facility with which the tax was collected.</p>

<p>The same Baron de Wulffen has not pleased me, having
left little debts behind him unpaid, though I furnished him
with twenty guineas. As he had been with his brother at
Venloo, before he saw you, where he might get money,
I wonder at his borrowing of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>This will be delivered to you by his Excellency John
Adams, whom I earnestly recommend to your best civilities.
He has never been in Holland, and your counsels
will be of use to him.</p>

<p class="close">
My best wishes attend you, being ever, &amp;c.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, August 9th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>With this your Excellency will receive a copy of my
last, dated May 31st, the original of which, with copies of
preceding letters, went by the Alliance, Captain Landais,
who sailed the beginning of last month, and who I wish
may arrive safe in America, being apprehensive that by
her long delay in port, from the mutiny of the people, who
after she was ready to sail refused to weigh anchor till their
wages were paid, she may fall in the way of the English
fleet now out, or that her crew, who have ever been infected
with disorder and mutiny, may carry her into England.
She had, on her first coming out, a conspiracy for
that purpose, besides which, her officers and Captain
quarrelled with each other, the Captain with Commodore
Jones, and there have been so many broils among them,
that it was impossible to get the business forward while she
staid, and she is at length gone, without taking the quantity
of stores she was capable of taking, and was ordered
to take.</p>

<p>I suppose the conduct of that Captain will be inquired
into by a Court Martial. Captain Jones goes home in the
Ariel, a ship we have borrowed of government here, and
carries one hundred and fortysix chests of arms, and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hundred barrels of powder. To take the rest of the
stores, I have been obliged to freight a ship, which being
well armed and well manned will, I hope, get in safe.
The clothes for ten thousand men are, I think, all made
up; there are also arms for fifteen thousand, new and
good, with two thousand barrels of powder. Besides
this, there is a great quantity of cloth I have bought, of
which you will have the invoices sent by Mr Williams;
another large quantity purchased by Mr Ross; all going
in the same ship.</p>

<p>The little authority we have here to govern our armed
ships, and the inconvenience of distance from the ports,
occasion abundance of irregularities in the conduct of both
men and officers. I hope, therefore, that no more of those
vessels will be sent hither, till our code of laws is perfected
respecting ships abroad, and proper persons appointed
to manage such affairs in the sea ports. They
give me infinite trouble; and though I endeavor to act for
the best, it is without satisfaction to myself, being unacquainted
with that kind of business. I have often mentioned
the appointment of a consul or consuls. The
Congress have, perhaps, not yet had time to consider that
matter.</p>

<p>Having already sent you, by different conveyances,
copies of my proceedings with the Court of Denmark,
relative to the three prizes delivered up to the English,
and requested the instructions of Congress, I hope soon
to receive them. I mentioned a letter from the Congress
to that Court, as what I thought might have a good effect.
I have since had more reasons to be of that opinion.</p>

<p>The unexpected delay of Mr Deane's arrival has
retarded the settlement of the joint accounts of the commission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
he having had the chief management of the commercial
part, and being therefore best able to explain
difficulties. I have just now the pleasure to hear that the
Fier Rodrique, with the convoy from Virginia, arrived at
Bordeaux all safe except one tobacco ship, that foundered
at sea, the men saved, and I have a letter from Mr Deane
that he is at Rochelle, proposes to stop a few days at
Nantes, and then proceed to Paris, when I shall endeavor
to see that business completed with all possible expedition.</p>

<p>Mr Adams has given offence to the Court here, by
some sentiments and expressions contained in several of
his letters written to the Count de Vergennes. I mention
this with reluctance, though perhaps it would have been
my duty to acquaint you with such a circumstance, even
were it not required of me by the Minister himself. He
has sent me copies of the correspondence, desiring I
would communicate them to Congress; and I send them
herewith.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Mr Adams did not show me his letters before
he sent them. I have, in a former letter to Mr
Lovell, mentioned some of the inconveniences that attend
the having more than one Minister at the same Court, one
of which inconveniences is, that they do not always hold
the same language, and that the impressions made by one,
and intended for the service of his constituents, may be
effaced by the discourse of the other. It is true, that
Mr Adams's proper business is elsewhere, but the time
not being come for that business, and having nothing else
here wherewith to employ himself, he seems to have endeavored
supplying what he may suppose my negotiations
defective in. He thinks, as he tells me himself, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
America has been too free in expressions of gratitude to
France; for that she is more obliged to us than we to
her; and that we should show spirit in our applications.
I apprehend that he mistakes his ground, and that this
Court is to be treated with decency and delicacy. The
King, a young and virtuous Prince, has, I am persuaded,
a pleasure in reflecting on the generous benevolence of the
action in assisting an oppressed people, and proposes it as
a part of the glory of his reign. I think it right to increase
this pleasure by our thankful acknowledgments,
and that such an expression of gratitude is not only our
duty, but our interest. A different conduct seems to me
what is not only improper and unbecoming, but what may
be hurtful to us. Mr Adams, on the other hand, who, at
the same time means our welfare and interest as much as
I, or any man can do, seems to think a little apparent
stoutness, and a greater air of independence and boldness
in our demands, will procure us more ample assistance.
It is for the Congress to judge and regulate their affairs
accordingly.</p>

<p>M. de Vergennes, who appears much offended, told me
yesterday that he would enter into no further discussions
with Mr Adams, nor answer any more of his letters. He
is gone to Holland to try, as he told me, whether something
might not be done to render us less dependent on
France. He says the ideas of this Court and those of
the people in America are so totally different, that it
is impossible for any Minister to please both. He ought
to know America better than I do, having been there
lately, and he may choose to do what he thinks will best
please the people of America. But when I consider the
expressions of Congress in many of their public acts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
particularly in their letter to the Chevalier de la Luzerne,
of the 24th of May last, I cannot but imagine that he
mistakes the sentiments of a few for a general opinion. It
is my intention, while I stay here, to procure what advantages
I can for our country, by endeavoring to please this
Court; and I wish I could prevent anything being said
by any of our countrymen here, that may have a contrary
effect, and increase an opinion lately showing itself in
Paris, that we seek a difference, and with a view of
reconciling ourselves to England. Some of them have of
late been very indiscreet in their conversations.</p>

<p>I have received, eight months after their date, the instructions
of Congress relating to a new article for guarantying
the fisheries. The expected negotiations for a peace
appearing of late more remote, and being too much occupied
with other affairs, I have not hitherto proposed that
article. But I purpose doing it next week. It appears so
reasonable and equitable, that I do not foresee any difficulty.
In my next I shall give you an account of what
passes on the occasion.</p>

<p>The silver medal ordered for the Chevalier de Fleury,
has been delivered to his order here, he being gone to
America. The others for Brigadier General Wayne, and
Colonel Stewart, I shall send by the next good opportunity.</p>

<p>The two thousand pounds I furnished to Messrs Adams
and Jay, agreeable to an order of Congress, for themselves
and Secretaries, being nearly expended, and no supplies to
them arriving, I have thought it my duty to furnish them
with further sums, hoping the supplies promised will soon
arrive to reimburse me, and enable me to pay the bills
drawn on Mr Laurens in Holland, which I have engaged
for, to save the public credit, the holders of those bills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
threatening otherways to protest them. Messrs de Neufvilles
of Amsterdam had accepted some of them. I have
promised those gentlemen to provide for the payment before
they become due, and to accept such others as shall
be presented to me. I hear, and hope it is true, that the
drawing of such bills is stopped, and that their number
and value is not very great.</p>

<p>The bills drawn in favor of M. de Beaumarchais for
the interest of his debt are paid.</p>

<p>The German Prince, who gave me a proposal some
months since for furnishing troops to the Congress, has
lately desired an answer. I gave no expectation that it
was likely you would agree to such a proposal, but being
pressed to send it to you, it went with some of my former
letters.</p>

<p>M. Fouquet, who was employed by Congress to instruct
people in making gunpowder, is arrived here, after a long
passage; he has requested me to transmit a memorial to
Congress, which I do enclosed.</p>

<p>The great public event in Europe of this year, is the
proposal by Russia of an armed neutrality for protecting the
liberty of commerce. The proposition is accepted now
by most of the maritime powers. As it is likely to become
the law of nations, <em>that free ships should make free goods</em>,
I wish the Congress to consider, whether it may not be
proper to give orders to their cruisers not to molest foreign
ships, but conform to the spirit of that treaty of
neutrality.</p>

<p>The English have been much elated with their success
at Charleston. The late news of the junction of the French
and Spanish fleets, has a little abated their spirits; and I
hope that junction, and the arrival of the French troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and ships in North America, will soon produce news, that
may afford us also in our turn some satisfaction.</p>

<p>Application has been made to me here, requesting that
I would solicit Congress to permit the exchange of William
John Mawhood, a Lieutenant in the 17th regiment,
taken prisoner at Stony Point, July 15th, 1779, and confined
near Philadelphia, or if the exchange cannot conveniently
be made, that he may be permitted to return to England
on his parole. By doing this at my request, the
Congress will enable me to oblige several friends of ours,
who are persons of merit and distinction in this country.</p>

<p>Be pleased, Sir, to present my duty to Congress, and
believe me to be, with great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> A similar application has been made to me in
favor of Richard Croft, Lieutenant in the 20th regiment, a
prisoner at Charlottesville. I shall be much obliged by
any kindness shown to that young gentleman, and so will
some friends of ours in England, who respect his father.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, August 10th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received on the 12th of June, 1780, copies of your
several favors of April the 29th, 1779, June the 13th,
1779, July the 9th and 16th, August and September the
16th, 1779. You will see by this what delays our correspondence
sometimes meets with. I have lately received
two of fresher date, viz. February the 24th, and May
the 4th. I thank you much for the newspapers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
journals you have from time to time sent me; I endeavor
to make full returns in the same way. I could furnish a
multitude of despatches with confidential informations
taken out of the papers I send you, if I chose to deal in
that kind of manufacture; I know the whole art of it, for I
have had several volunteer correspondents in England,
who have in their letters for years together communicated
to me secrets of state, extracted from the newspapers,
which sometimes came to hand in those papers by the
same post, and sometimes by the post before. You and
I send the papers themselves. Our letters may appear
the leaner, but what fat they have is their own.</p>

<p>I wrote to you the 17th of October, and the 16th of
March, and have sent duplicates, some of which I hope
got to hand. You mention receiving one of September
the 30th, and one of December the 30th, but not that of
October the 17th. The cypher you have communicated,
either from some defect in your explanation, or in my
comprehension, is not yet of use to me; for I cannot understand
by it the little specimen you have written in it. If
you have that of M. Dumas, which I left with Mr Morris,
we may correspond by it when a few sentences are required
only to be written in cypher, but it is too tedious for
a whole letter.</p>

<p>I send herewith copies of the instruments annulling the
11th and 12th articles of the treaty.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The treaty printed
here by the Court omitted them, and numbered the subsequent
articles accordingly.</p>

<p>I write fully to the President. The frequent hinderances
the Committee of Correspondence meet with in writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as a committee, which appear from the excuses in your
particular letters, and the many parts of my letters, that
have long been unanswered, incline me to think, that your
foreign correspondence would be best managed by one
secretary, who could write when he had an opportunity,
without waiting for the concurrence or opinions of his
brethren, who cannot always be got conveniently together.
My chief letters will, therefore, for the future be addressed
to the President, till further orders.</p>

<p>I send you enclosed some more of Mr Hartley's letters.
He continues passionately to desire peace with America,
but wishes we could be separated from France.</p>

the receipt of your letter of May the 31st. I
think I can venture now to assure you, that not a single
draft more will be made upon you, let the occasion be
ever so pressing; but you must be entreated to work with
all energy as to the past. You cannot conceive of the
whole train of necessities, which led to such decisions,
after what you had written. Congress have lately called
for three millions more than formerly, estimating in silver,
to be paid by the last of December. Nothing but the
weight of taxes will put an end to the levity with which
our currency is treated.</p>

<p>New York has empowered its delegates to cede part of

<p class="head">
Passy, October 2d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received duly your several letters of the 12th, 15th,
17th, 19th, and 21st of September. I am much pleased
with the intelligence you sent me, and with the papers you
have had printed.</p>

<p>Mr Searle is a military officer in the Pennsylvania
troops, and a member of Congress. He has some commission
to execute for that province, but none that I know
of from Congress. He has an open letter for you from
Mr Lovell, which he has shown me. It is full of expressions
of his esteem; and I understand from Mr Searle,
that you stand exceedingly well with the Committee and
with the Congress in general. I am sorry to see any
marks of uneasiness and apprehension in your letters.
M. Chaumont tells me, that you want some assurance of
being continued. The Congress itself is changeable at
the pleasure of their electors, and none of their servants
have, or can have, any such assurance. If, therefore, anything
better for you, and more substantial should offer,
nobody can blame you for accepting it, however satisfied
they may be with your services. But as to the continuance
of what you may enjoy, or of something as valuable in
the service of the Congress, I think you may make yourself
easy, for your appointment seems more likely to be
increased than diminished, though it does not belong to
me to promise anything.</p>

<p>Mr Laurens was to sail three days after Mr Searle, who
begins to fear he must be lost, as it was a small vessel he
intended to embark in. He was bound directly to Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>I enclose some extracts of letters from two French officers
of distinction in the army of M. de Rochambeau,
which are pleasing, as they mark the good intelligence that
subsists between the troops, contrary to the reports circulated
by the English.</p>

<p>I received yours of the 29th of September and 3d of
October. It is a very good addition you have made to
your Memoir for the Ministers of Russia and Sweden. I
am glad to find you are again on such good terms with the

of your continuing to cultivate that good understanding. I

<p>Your information relative to the transactions at Petersburgh

me a good deal of satisfaction, particularly the former.
Mr Searle will have the pleasure of seeing you. I recommend
him warmly to your civilities. He is much your
friend, and will advise Mr Laurens to make you his secretary,
which I hope you will accept. I have given it as my
opinion, that Mr L. can nowhere find one better qualified,
or more deserving. The choice is left to that Minister,
and he is empowered to give a salary of £500 sterling a
year. I am in pain on account of his not being yet arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

would find means to introduce Mr Searle to the Portuguese

and after advising with your friend, give me your opinion
as to the manner of the application to the States-General,
whether I should make it through their Ambassador, or

other manner. You know we wrote to him formerly, and

<h3>JAMES LOVELL TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, October 28th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>A Committee was appointed on the 6th to draft "a letter
to our Ministers at the Courts of Versailles and Madrid, to
enforce the instructions given by Congress to Mr Jay, by
their resolutions of the 4th instant, and so to explain the
reasons and principles on which the same are founded,
that they may respectively be enabled to satisfy those
Courts of the justice and equity of the intentions of

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I understand that Mr Laurens, an American gentleman,
for whom I have a great esteem, is a prisoner in the Tower,
and that his health suffers by the closeness and rigor of his
confinement. As I do not think that your affairs receive
any advantage from the harshness of this proceeding, I
take the freedom of requesting your kind interposition, to
obtain for him such a degree of air and liberty, on his
parole or otherwise, as may be necessary for his health
and comfort. The fortune of war, which is daily changing,
may possibly put it in my power to do the like good
office for some friend of yours, which I shall perform with
much pleasure, not only for the sake of humanity, but in
respect to the ashes of our former friendship.</p>

<p>With great regard, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I am much ashamed to think that I shall appear so dilatory
in answering the favor of your letter, but the truth is,
I was not in town when the messenger left it in Cork
Street, and by the neglect of my servants I received it
only on Sunday last. I went immediately to the Tower, to
know from Mr Laurens himself if he had any cause of complaint,
and if he had availed himself of the indulgence allowed
him by the Secretary of State, of walking within the
Tower whenever it was agreeable to himself. His answer
to me was full and frank to the questions, that he had received
every reasonable indulgence since his confinement,
and that by the liberty allowed him of walking, he found his
health much mended. He said, at the same time, that he
had always thought himself highly honored by the distinguished
place of his confinement, and regretted much it
was not in his power to make known to all the world, the
acknowledgments he had more than once made to me
upon this subject.</p>

<p>I beg you will do me the favor to communicate these
particulars to Lord George Germain as soon as convenient.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS FROM CONGRESS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
In Congress, November 29th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The letters to His Most Christian Majesty, which accompany
these instructions, you will deliver without loss
of time; you will on all occasions, and in the strongest
terms, represent the unalterable resolutions of these United
States to maintain their liberties and independence, and
invariably to adhere to the alliance at every hazard, and in
every event. That the misfortunes of the last campaign,
instead of repressing, have redoubled their ardor. That
Congress are resolved to employ every resource in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
power to expel the enemy from every part of the United
States, by the most vigorous and decisive co-operation with
the marine and troops of their illustrious ally; that they
have called for a powerful army and ample supplies of
provisions, and that the States are disposed effectually to a
compliance with their requisitions. That if, in aid of our
own exertions, the Court of Spain can be prevailed on to
assume a naval superiority in the American seas, to furnish
the arms, ammunition, and clothing specified in the estimate
herewith transmitted, and to assist us with the loan
mentioned in the letter, we flatter ourselves, that under
the divine blessing the war must be speedily terminated,
with glory and advantage to both nations. To procure
these necessary aids you will employ unremitted attention
and your utmost abilities; your own knowledge of our
circumstances, and the fact suggested in the letter, will
supply you with abundant argument to enforce our requisitions.</p>

<p>You will give Colonel Palfrey, late Paymaster General
for our armies, and now our Consul in France, all the
support which is necessary for the exercise of his Consular
functions, as well as for the effectual execution of the
special authority and instructions, which he will communicate.
The sufferings of our army for the want of the
clothing and arms, which the grant of His Most Christian
Majesty, and your own despatch gave us reason to expect,
and the absolute and increasing necessity of their being
immediately forwarded to give efficacy to our future operations,
will especially impress upon you the dangerous
consequences of a further disappointment.</p>

<p>With respect to the loan, we foresee, that the sum we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
ask will be greatly inadequate to our wants. We wish,
however, to depend as much as possible on our internal
exertions. In this negotiation the state of our finances
requires, that you should endeavor to procure as long a
respite after the war for payment of the principal as may
be in your power. You may agree for an interest not
exceeding the terms allowed or given on national security,
in endeavoring to suspend the discharge of the interest for
two or three years if possible.</p>

<p>The loan must prove ineffectual, unless the specie is
actually remitted. Experience has shown, that the negotiations
of bills is attended with insuperable loss and disadvantage.
His Most Christian Majesty, we are persuaded,
will see in the strongest light the necessity of despatching
an effective naval armament to the American
seas. This is a measure of such vast moment, that your
utmost address will be employed to give it success. By
such a conveyance the specie may be remitted by different
ships of war with a prospect of safety.</p>

<p>You are instructed to procure a correspondence with
Monsieur Stephen d'Andibert Caille, Consul for unrepresented
nations at the Court of the Emperor of Morocco.
Assure him in the name of Congress, and in the most
respectful terms, that we entertain a sincere disposition to
cultivate the most perfect friendship with the Emperor of
Morocco, and are desirous of entering into a treaty of
commerce with him, and that we shall embrace a favorable
opportunity to announce our wishes in form. You are to
take upon yourself, as far as may be consistent with your
present functions, the office of adjusting preliminaries for a
treaty with that Prince, according to the articles herewith
forwarded; provided, that you shall conceive it for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
honor and interest of the United States to make such
overtures, and it shall be agreeable to the Court at which
you reside.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, December 2d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I duly received your several favors of August the 15th,
and September the 7th, with the resolves of Congress for
drawing on the bills extraordinary, to the amount of near
three hundred thousand dollars. To keep up the credit
of Congress I had already engaged for those drawn on
Mr Laurens. You cannot conceive how much these
things perplex and distress me; for the practice of this
government being yearly to apportion the revenue to the
several expected services, any after demands made, which
the treasury is not furnished to supply, meet with great
difficulty, and are very disagreeable to the Ministers. To
enable me to look these drafts in the face, I have agreed
to a proposal contained in the enclosed letter to the President
of furnishing provisions to the King's forces in America,
which proposal I hope will be approved and executed,
and that the Congress will strictly comply with the assurance
you have given me, not to draw on me any
more without first knowing that they have funds in my
hands.</p>

<p>I wrote to you more fully by Captain Jones. He sailed
sometime since in the Ariel, but met with a severe storm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that entirely dismasted him, and obliged him to put back
for France. He has been long refitting, but will sail again
soon. Everything goes well here.</p>

<p>With great esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, December 2d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The many mutual advantages, that must arise from carrying
into execution the proposition already communicated
to Congress, of furnishing provisions to the King's forces
in America, to be paid for here, have, I make no doubt,
already induced them to begin that operation. But as the
proposition has lately been renewed to me, on occasion of
my requesting further aids of money, to answer the unexpected
drafts drawn upon me ordered by the resolutions of
May and August last, which drafts it is absolutely necessary
I should find funds to pay; and as the Congress have long
desired to have the means of forming funds in Europe,
and an easier, cheaper, and safer method cannot possibly
be contrived, and as I see by the journals of February,
that the several States were to furnish provisions in quantities
instead of supplies in money, whereby much will be
in the disposition of Congress, I flatter myself that they
will not disapprove of my engaging in their behalf with the
Minister of the Finances here, that they will cause to be
delivered for the King's land and sea forces in North America
such provisions, as may be wanted from time to time,
to the amount of four hundred thousand dollars, the said
provisions to be furnished at the current prices, for which
they might be bought with silver specie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>I have constantly done my utmost to support the credit
of Congress, by procuring wherewith punctually to pay all
their drafts, and I have no doubt of their care to support
mine in this instance by fulfilling honorably my engagement;
in which case, receipts in due form should be taken
of the person to whom the provisions are delivered in the
several States, and those receipts sent to me here.</p>

<p>With great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> This value, 400,000 dollars, is to be considered
as exclusive of any provisions already furnished, but the
receipts for those should also be sent me, if not paid for
there.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, December 3d, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I duly received the letter your Excellency did me the
honor of writing to me on the 12th of July past, by Mr
Searle, and have paid the bills drawn on me by order of
Congress in favor of the President and Council of Pennsylvania,
for one thousand pounds sterling, which were presented
by him. He is at present in Holland.</p>

<p>The news of Mr Laurens having been taken must have
reached you long since; he is confined in the Tower, but
of late has some more liberty for taking air and exercise
than first was allowed him. Certain papers found with
him relating to the drafts of a treaty proposed in Holland,
have been sent over to the Stadtholder, who laid them before
their High Mightinesses, who communicated them to
the government of the city of Amsterdam, which justified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the transaction. This has drawn from England a memorial,
delivered by Sir Joseph Yorke, demanding that the
Pensionary and Magistrates of that city should be punished,
and declaring that the King will resent a refusal of
the States to comply with this demand. What answer will
be given to this insolent memorial we do not yet know.
But I hear it has produced much displeasure in Holland,
and it is thought to have occasioned a more prompt accession
to the armed neutrality, which had before met with
obstructions from the English party there.</p>

<p>We have met with a variety of unaccountable delays and
difficulties in the affair of shipping the clothing and stores.
The Alliance went away without taking her part. The
Ariel sailed, but met a storm at sea that dismasted her, and
obliged her to return to France. She is nearly again ready
to sail. Mr Ross, with his cargo of clothes in the Duke of
Leinster, sailed under convoy of the Ariel, but did not return
with her, and I hope may get safe to America. The
great ship we hired to come to L'Orient, and take in the
rest of what we had to send, has been long unexpectedly
detained at Bordeaux. I am afraid the army has suffered
for want of the clothes; but it has been as impossible for
me to avoid, as it was to foresee these delays.</p>

<p>The late Minister of the Marine here, M. de Sartine, is
removed, and his place supplied by M. le Marquis de Castries.
But this change does not effect the general system
of the Court, which continues favorable to us.</p>

<p>I have received a copy of the resolutions of Congress of
the 19th of May, and the 9th, 15th, 23d, and 30th of August,
directing bills to be drawn on me for near 300,000
dollars. I shall accept the bills, hoping the Congress will
approve of, and readily comply with the proposition, contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
in a letter to your Excellency, accompanying this,
dated the 2d instant. Probably an answer may arrive
here before many of those bills shall become due, as few
of them are yet arrived. If that answer ratifies the agreement
I have made, I shall have no difficulty in finding
means to pay the rest. If not, I shall scarce be able to
bear the reproaches of merchants, that I have misled them
to their loss by my acceptations, which gave a promise of
payment, that not being fulfilled, has deranged their affairs,
to say nothing of the power I am told the Consul's Court
here has over the persons, even of Ministers, in the case
of bills of exchange. Let me, therefore, beg your Excellency
to use your endeavors with Congress, that this matter
may be immediately attended to.</p>

<p>Mr Jay, no doubt, has acquainted you with his difficulties
respecting the drafts upon him. I am sorry I cannot
extricate him, but I hope he will still find means.</p>

<p>The Mars, an armed ship belonging to the State of
Massachusetts, in her way to France, took and sent to
New England a Portuguese ship bound to Cork, with salt,
belonging to some merchants there. The Portuguese Captain,
who is brought in here, complains heavily of ill usage
and plunder, besides taking his vessel, and the Ambassador
of that nation has communicated to me these complaints,
together with all the papers proving the property of the
vessel, &amp;c. representing at the same time the good disposition
of the Queen towards our States, and his wishes that
nothing might lessen it, or tend to prevent or delay a complete
good understanding between the two nations. I advised
that the owners should send over their claim, and
empower some person to prosecute it, in which case I did
not doubt our courts would do them justice. I hope the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Congress may think fit to take some notice of this affair,
and not only forward a speedy decision, but give orders to
our cruisers not to meddle with neutral ships for the future,
it being a practice apt to produce ill blood, and contrary to
the spirit of the new league, which is approved by all Europe;
and the English property found in such vessels will
hardly pay the damages brought on us by the irregular
proceedings of our Captains, in endeavoring to get at such
property.</p>

<p>With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>JAMES LOVELL TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, December 21st, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The bearer, William Palfrey, our late Paymaster General,
has been appointed Consul in France, with powers
adequate to a general agency in our commercial concerns
there. But, while I take up my pen to introduce him to
your patronage, I ought to use it rather, perhaps, by way
of apologising for myself, in the line of a member of the
Committee of Foreign Affairs, from whom you will find
no letter. There was a prospect of much business being
committed to you by this opportunity, but it was altogether
depending upon the President and Secretary to
transmit it, which, it seems, they were prevented from
doing, by an arrangement being but partly accomplished,
which Congress has thought fit to connect with those
affairs. This proceeding is of a nature not to admit of
my enlarging upon it, because neither my head nor heart
suggests anything of eulogium, and my conscience forbids
me to pursue the usual style of minorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>The Journals which I send you will show that we have
had no letter from you since that of May last, except
two short ones lately, respecting the private concerns of

<h3>ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM CONGRESS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
In Congress, December 27th, 1780.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Since your last instructions<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Congress have thought it
expedient to send Colonel John Laurens, with powers to
negotiate specially the important affairs to which they more
immediately relate. This gentleman, from the nature of
his services and situation, has had opportunities of information,
which peculiarly qualify him for giving to His Most
Christian Majesty a more lively idea of our circumstances,
of our indispensable wants, and of the great advantages
which must result to the allies from his Majesty's complying
with our request.</p>

<p>The negotiation is, besides, so critically important, that
it was deemed highly requisite by the mission of this
special Minister, to guard against the accident of your want
of health, and the consequent delay in making the application.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this appointment, should the duplicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the despatches reach you before this Minister's arrival,
you will consider it as the desire of Congress, that you
take, with all possible expedition, every step in your power
for effecting the business, or at least for disposing His Most
Christian Majesty and his Ministers to take a favorable
impression from the representation which Colonel Laurens,
from his advantages of fuller information, may be better
able to make.</p>

<p>It is intended, and it is well known to be his own disposition,
to avail himself of your information and influence,
and Congress doubt not that the success of this measure
will be much promoted by the assistance he will derive
from you; and they desire you to consider your attention
to him as a matter, which will be very satisfactory to Congress
and advantageous to your country.</p>

<h3>TO COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, February 13th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received from Congress their letter for the
King, which I have the honor of putting herewith into the
hands of your Excellency. I am charged at the same time,
to "represent in the strongest terms, the unalterable resolution
of the United States to maintain their liberties and independence;
and inviolably to adhere to the alliance at
every hazard, and in every event; and that the misfortunes
of the last campaign, instead of repressing, have redoubled
their ardor; that Congress are resolved to employ every resource
in their power to expel the enemy from every part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the United States, by the most vigorous and decisive
co-operation with marine and other forces of their illustrious
ally; that they have accordingly called on the several
States for a powerful army and ample supplies of provisions;
and that the States are disposed effectually to
comply with their requisitions. That, if in aid of their
own exertions, the Court of France can be prevailed on to
assume a naval superiority in the American seas, to furnish
the arms, ammunition, and clothing, specified in the estimate
heretofore transmitted, and to assist with the loan
mentioned in the letter, they flatter themselves, that under
the divine blessing, the war must speedily be terminated,
with glory and advantage to both nations."</p>

<p>By several letters to me from intelligent persons, it appears,
that the great and expensive exertions of the last
year, by which a force was assembled capable of facing
the enemy, and which accordingly drew towards New
York, and lay long near that city, was rendered ineffectual
by the superiority of the enemy at sea, and that their
successes in Carolina had been chiefly owing to that superiority,
and to the want of the necessary means for
furnishing, marching, and paying the expense of troops
sufficient to defend that province. The Marquis de Lafayette
writes to me, that it is impossible to conceive,
without seeing it, the distress which the troops have
suffered for want of clothing, and the following is a paragraph
of a letter from General Washington, which I ought
not to keep back from your Excellency, viz. "I doubt
not that you are so fully informed by Congress of our political
and military State, that it would be superfluous to
trouble you with anything relative to either. If I were
to speak on topics of the kind, it would be to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
our present situation makes one of two things essential
to us; a peace, or the most vigorous aid of our allies,
particularly in the article of <em>money</em>. Of their disposition
to serve us, we cannot doubt; their generosity will do
everything which their means will permit." They had in
America great expectations, I know not on what foundation,
that a considerable supply of money would be obtained
from Spain; but that expectation has failed, and
the force of that nation in those seas has been employed
to reduce small forts in Florida, without rendering any
direct assistance to the United States; and indeed the
long delay of that Court, in acceding to the treaty of commerce,
begins to have the appearance of its not inclining to
have any connexion with us; so that for effectual friendship,
and for the aid so necessary in the present conjuncture,
we can rely on France alone, and in the continuance
of the King's goodness towards us.</p>

<p>I am grown old. I feel myself much enfeebled by my
late long illness, and it is probable I shall not long have
any more concern in these affairs. I therefore take this
occasion to express my opinion to your Excellency, that
the present conjuncture is critical, that there is some
danger lest the Congress should lose its influence over the
people, if it is found unable to procure the aids that are
wanted; and that the whole system of the new government
in America may thereby be shaken. That if the
English are suffered once to recover that country, such an
opportunity of effectual separation as the present may not
occur again in the course of ages; and that the possession
of those fertile and extensive regions, and that vast sea-coast,
will afford them so broad a basis for future greatness,
by the rapid growth of their commerce, and breed of seamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and soldiers, as will enable them to become the <em>terror
of Europe</em>, and to exercise with impunity that insolence,
which is so natural to their nation, and which will increase
enormously with the increase of their power.</p>

As that list is of old date, and I do not know what part

order the making of a quantity of soldiers' and officers'
clothing, equal to one third part of what has been demanded
from page 31 to page 42 inclusive; and to collect
and get ready also one third of the other articles mentioned
in the said pages, which I have marked with a red
line in the margin, the whole to be sent by the first good
opportunity. I think it would be well also to send five
thousand more good fusils, with fifty tons of lead, and two
hundred thousand flints for fusils. If these could go with
the fleet, it would be of great service. More powder is
not necessary to be sent at present, as there goes in the
Marquis de Lafayette the remainder of the two thousand
barrels granted last year, and also two hundred tons of saltpetre,
which they will make into powder. For the other
articles that may be wanted, as Colonel Laurens will come
fully instructed, as well by the list given to him as from his
own observation and experience in the army, and from the
information he will receive from General Washington, with
whom and the Marquis de Lafayette he was to consult
before his departure, I conceive it will be best to wait a
little for his arrival.</p>

<p>I return the lists, and having by some unaccountable
accident mislaid and lost the paper you gave me, containing
what Count de Vergennes said to me yesterday, I
must beg the favor of you to repeat it, and send it by the
bearer. I am ashamed to give you this trouble, but I wish
to be exact in what I am writing of it to Congress.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 12th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I had the honor of receiving on the 13th of last month
your Excellency's letter of the 1st of January, together
with the instructions of November 28th, and December
27th, a copy of those to Colonel Laurens, and the letter to
the King. I immediately drew a memorial, enforcing as
strongly as I could the requests that are contained in that
letter, and directed by the instructions, and I delivered the
same with the letter, which were both well received; but
the Ministry being extremely occupied with other weighty
affairs, and I obtaining for some time only general answers,
that something would be done for us, &amp;c. and Mr Laurens
not arriving, I wrote again and pressed strongly for a decision
on the subject, that I might be able to write explicitly
by this opportunity, what aids the Congress were or
were not to expect, the regulation of their operations for
the campaign depending on the information I should be
enabled to give.</p>

<p>Upon this I received a note, appointing Saturday last
for a meeting with the Minister, which I attended punctually.
He assured me of the King's good will to the
United States, remarking, however, that being on the spot,
I must be sensible of the great expense France was
actually engaged in, and the difficulty of providing for it,
which rendered the lending us twentyfive millions at present
impracticable; but he informed me, that the letter
from the Congress, and my memorials, had been under his
Majesty's consideration, and observed, as to loans in general,
that the sum we wanted to borrow in Europe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
large, and that the depreciation of our paper had hurt our
credit on this side of the water; adding also, that the King
could not possibly favor a loan for us in his dominions, because
it would interfere with and be a prejudice to those
he was under the necessity of obtaining himself to support
the war; but that, to give the States a signal proof of his
friendship, his Majesty had resolved to grant them the sum
of six millions, not as a loan, but as a free gift. This sum
the Minister informed me was exclusive of the three millions,
which he had before obtained for me to pay the Congress
drafts for interest, &amp;c. expected in the current year.
He added, that as it was understood the clothing, &amp;c. with
which our army had been heretofore supplied from France,
was often of bad quality and dear, the Ministers would
themselves take care of the purchase of such articles as
should be immediately wanted, and send them over; and
it was desired of me to look over the great invoice, that
had been sent hither last year, and mark out those articles;
that as to the money remaining after such purchases,
it was to be drawn for by General Washington, upon M.
d'Harvelay, Garde du Tresor Royal, and the bills would
be duly honored; but it was desired they might be drawn
gradually as the money should be wanted, and as much
time given for the payment after sight as conveniently
could be, that the payment might be more easy.</p>

<p>I assured the Minister, that the Congress would be very
sensible of this token of his Majesty's continued goodness
towards the United States; but remarked, that it was not
the usage with us for the General to draw, and proposed
that it might be our Treasurer, who should draw the bills
for the remainder; but I was told that it was his Majesty's
order. And I afterwards understood from the Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of the Council, that as the sum was intended for the supply
of the army, and could not be so large as we had
demanded for general occasions, it was thought best to put
it into the General's hands, that it might not get into those
of the different Boards or Committees, who might think
themselves under a necessity of diverting it to other purposes.
There was no room to dispute on this point, every
donor having the right of qualifying his gifts with such
terms as he thinks proper.</p>

<p>I took with me the invoice, and having examined it, I
returned it immediately with a letter, of which a copy is
enclosed, and I suppose its contents will be followed, unless
Colonel Laurens on his arrival should make any
changes. I hope he and Colonel Palfrey are safe, though,
as yet, not heard of.</p>

<p>After the discourse relating to the aid was ended, the
Minister proceeded to inform me, that the Courts of Petersburgh
and Vienna had offered their mediation; that
the King had answered, that it would to him personally be
agreeable, but that he could not yet accept it, because he
had allies whose concurrence was necessary. And that
his Majesty desired I would acquaint the Congress with
this offer and answer, and urge their sending such instructions
as they may think proper to their Plenipotentiary,
it being not doubted that they would readily accept
the proposed mediation, from their own sense of its being
both useful and necessary. I mentioned that I supposed
Mr Adams was already furnished with instructions,
relating to any treaty of peace that might be proposed.</p>

<p>I must now beg leave to say something relating to myself,
a subject with which I have not often troubled the Congress.
I have passed my seventyfifth year, and I find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the long and severe fit of the gout, which I had the last
winter, has shaken me exceedingly, and I am yet far from
having recovered the bodily strength I before enjoyed. I
do not know that my mental faculties are impaired; perhaps
I shall be the last to discover that; but I am sensible
of great diminution in my activity, a quality I think particularly
necessary in your Minister for this Court. I am
afraid, therefore, that your affairs may some time or other
suffer by my deficiency. I find also that the business is
too heavy for me, and too confining. The constant attendance
at home, which is necessary for receiving and
accepting your Bills of Exchange, (a matter foreign to my
ministerial functions) to answer letters, and perform other
parts of my employment, prevents my taking the air and
exercise, which my annual journeys formerly used to afford
me, and which contributed much to the preservation of my
health. There are many other little personal attentions,
which the infirmities of age render necessary to an old
man's comfort, even in some degree to the continuance of
his existence, and with which business often interferes.</p>

<p>I have been engaged in public affairs, and enjoyed public
confidence, in some shape or other, during the long
term of fifty years, and honor sufficient to satisfy any
reasonable ambition, and I have no other left but that of
repose, which I hope the Congress will grant me, by
sending some person to supply my place. At the same
time, I beg they may be assured, that it is not any the
least doubt of their success in the glorious cause, nor any
disgust received in their service, that induces me to decline
it, but purely and simply the reasons abovementioned.
And as I cannot at present undergo the fatigues of a sea
voyage, (the last having been almost too much for me) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
would not again expose myself to the hazard of capture
and imprisonment in this time of war, I purpose to remain
here at least till the peace; perhaps it may be for
the remainder of my life; and if any knowledge or experience
I have acquired here may be thought of use to
my successor, I shall freely communicate it, and assist
him with any influence I may be supposed to have, or
counsel that may be desired of me.</p>

<p>I have one request more to make, which, if I have
served the Congress to their satisfaction, I hope they will
not refuse me; it is, that they will be pleased to take
under their protection my grandson, William Temple
Franklin. I have educated him from his infancy, and I
brought him over with an intention of placing him where
he might be qualified for the profession of the law; but
the constant occasion I had for his service as a private
Secretary during the time of the Commissioners, and more
extensively since their departure, has induced me to keep
him always with me; and indeed being continually disappointed
of the secretary Congress had at different times
intended me, it would have been impossible for me, without
this young gentleman's assistance, to have gone through
the business incumbent on me. He has therefore lost so
much of the time necessary for law studies, that I think it
rather advisable for him to continue, if it may be, in the
line of public foreign affairs, for which he seems qualified
by a sagacity and judgment above his years, and great diligence
and activity, exact probity, a genteel address, a
facility in speaking well the French tongue, and all the
knowledge of business to be obtained by a four years' constant
employment in the Secretary's office, where he may
be said to have served a kind of apprenticeship. After all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the allowance I am capable of making for the partiality of
a parent to his offspring, I cannot but think he may in
time make a very able foreign Minister for Congress, in
whose service his fidelity may be relied on. But I do not
at present propose him as such, for though he is now of
age, a few years more of experience will not be amiss.
In the meantime, if they should think fit to employ him as
a Secretary to their Minister at any European Court, I
am persuaded they will have reason to be satisfied with his
conduct, and I shall be thankful for his appointment as a
favor to me.</p>

<p>My accounts have been long ready for the examination of
some person to be appointed for that purpose. Mr Johnson
having declined it, and Mr Dana residing at present at
Paris, I requested him to undertake it, and to examine at
the same time those of Mr Deane; but he also declines
it, as being unacquainted with accounts. If no fresh appointment
has been made by Congress, I think of desiring
Mr Palfrey to perform that service when he arrives,
which I hope will be approved, for I am uneasy at the delay.</p>

<p>With great respect, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO FRANCIS LEWIS AND THE BOARD OF ADMIRALTY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 17th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>I received the honor of yours, dated January the 2d,
containing sundry questions relating to the ship Alliance,
and the expedition under the command of John Paul Jones.</p>

<p>I apprehend, that the letters and papers sent by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Alliance, if they came to your hands, and those which
went in the Ariel, taken together, would pretty well inform
you on the most of the particulars you inquire about, and
the deficiencies might be supplied by Captain Jones himself
and others, who were engaged in the expedition. But
as I learn from Colonel Laurens, that his arrival was not
heard of at Boston the 11th of February, though he sailed
the 18th of December, and possibly he may have miscarried,
I shall endeavor to answer as well as I can your
several queries, and will hereafter send you duplicates of
the papers that may be lost.</p>

<p>But I would previously remark, as to the expedition in
general, that this Court having, I suppose, some enterprise
in view, which Captain Jones, who had signalised his bravery
in taking the Drake, was thought a proper person to
conduct, had soon after that action requested we would
spare him to them, which was the more readily agreed to,
as a difference subsisted between him and his Lieutenant,
which laid us under a difficulty, that was by that means got
over. Some time passed, however, before any steps were
taken to employ him in a manner agreeable to him, and
possibly the first project was laid aside, many difficulties
attending any attempt of introducing a foreign officer into
the French marine, as it disturbs the order of their promotions,
&amp;c. and he himself choosing to act rather under the
commission of Congress. However, a project was at
length formed of furnishing him with some of the King's
ships, the officers of which were to have temporary American
commissions, which being posterior in date to his
commission, would put them naturally under his command
for the time; and the final intention, after various changes,
was to intercept the Baltic fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>The Alliance was at that time under orders to carry Mr
Adams back to America, but the Minister of the Marine,
by a written letter requesting I would lend her to strengthen
the little squadron, and offering a passage for Mr Adams
in one of the King's ships, I consented to the request,
hoping, that besides obliging the Minister, I might obtain
the disposition of some prisoners to exchange for our countrymen
in England.</p>

<p><em>Question 1st.</em> "Whether the ships with which the
frigate Alliance was concerted in an expedition, of which
Captain John Paul Jones had the command, were the
property of private persons, and if so, who were the owners
of those ships?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> The ships with which the Alliance was
concerted, were 1st. The Bon Homme Richard, bought
and fitted by the King, on purpose for Captain Jones.
2dly. The Pallas frigate. 3dly. The Vengeance, a corvette.
4thly. The Cerf, a cutter. All belonging to the
King, and the property of no private person whatever, as
far as I have ever heard or believe.</p>

<p>Two privateers, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i> and the <em>Granville</em>, were
indeed with the little squadron in going out; I suppose
to take advantage of the convoy, but being on their own
account, and at their own discretion, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i> quitted
company on the coast of Ireland, and the <em>Granville</em> returned
about the same time to France. I have not heard,
that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i> ever claimed any part of the prizes.
The <em>Granville</em> has made some claim, on account not only
of what were taken, while she was with the squadron, but
of the whole taken after her departure, on this pretence,
that some prisoners being put on board of her, and losing
company, she found herself obliged to go back with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
not having wherewith to maintain them, &amp;c. but this claim
is opposed by the other ships, being regarded as frivolous,
as she was not concerted. The claim, however, is not yet
decided, but hangs in the courts. These circumstances
show, that these vessels were not considered as a part of
the armament. But it appears more plainly by the <em>Concordat</em>
of the Captains, whereof I send you a copy. Who
the owners were of those privateers I have not heard. I
suppose they may be inhabitants of Bordeaux and Granville.</p>

<p><em>Question 2d.</em> "Whether any agreement was made
by you, or any person in your behalf, with the owners of
the ships concerted with the Alliance in that expedition,
respecting the shares they were severally to draw of the
prizes, which might be taken during said expedition?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> I never made any such agreement, nor any
person in my behalf. I lent the vessel to the King simply
at the Minister's request, supposing it would be agreeable
to Congress to oblige their ally, and that the division, if
there should be anything to divide, would be according to
the laws of France, or of America, as should be found
most equitable. But the Captains before they sailed entered
into an agreement, called the <em>Concordat</em> abovementioned,
to divide according to the rules of America, as
they acted under American commissions and colors.</p>

<p><em>Question 3d.</em> "Whether the Serapis and Scarborough,
and other captures made during said expedition, were divided
among the captors, and the distribution made according
to the resolutions of Congress, and if not, what mode
was pursued in making the distribution?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> No division has yet been made of the Serapis
and Scarborough. It is but lately that I have heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the money being ready for division at L'Orient. I suppose
the mode will be that agreed on by the captains.</p>

<p><em>Question 4th.</em> "What were the net proceeds of the
Serapis, Scarborough, and the other prizes taken during
the said expedition?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> I have not yet heard what were the net proceeds
of the prizes, nor have I seen any account. As soon
as such shall come to my hands, I will transmit it to you,
and will endeavor to obtain it speedily. No satisfaction
has yet been obtained for the prizes carried into Norway,
and delivered up by the King of Denmark.</p>

<p><em>Question 5th.</em> "What benefit the United States of
America have received from the prisoners made during
said expedition?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> I did expect to have had all the prisoners
taken by the squadron, to exchange for Americans, in consideration
of my having lent the Alliance, and Captain
Pearson engaged in behalf of the British government by
a written instrument, that those set on shore in Holland
should be considered as prisoners of war to the United
States, and exchanged accordingly. But I was, nevertheless,
disappointed in this expectation. For an exchange of
all the prisoners being proposed to be made in Holland, it
was found necessary at that time by the Dutch government,
in order to avoid embroiling their State with England,
that those prisoners should be considered as taken by
France, and they were accordingly exchanged for Frenchmen,
on the footing of the French cartel with England.
This I agreed to on the request of the French Ambassador
at the Hague, and also to avoid the risk of sending
them by sea to France, (the English cruising with seven
ships off the Texel to retake them) and as it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
more convenient and certain for us to have an equal number
of English delivered to me by France at or near Morlaix,
to be sent over in the cartel. But the English government
afterwards refused very unjustly to give any
Americans in exchange for English, that had not been
taken by Americans. So we did not reap the benefit we
hoped for.</p>

<p><em>Question 6th.</em> "What orders were given to Captain
Landais?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> That he should obey the orders of Captain
Jones.</p>

<p><em>Question 7th.</em> "What was the ground of dispute between
Captain Jones and him?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> That when at sea together, he refused to
obey Captain Jones's orders.</p>

<p><em>Question 8th.</em> "What were the disbursements on the
Alliance, from the time of her first arrival in France, until
she left that kingdom?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> The disbursements on the Alliance from the
time of her first arrival in France, till the commencement
of the cruise under Captain Jones, as appears by the accounts
of Mr Schweighauser, agent appointed by William
Lee, amounted to &mdash;&mdash; which I paid. The disbursements
on her refit in Holland were paid by the
King, as were also those on her second refit after her return
to L'Orient, as long as she was under the care of
Captain Jones. But Captain Landais, when he resumed
the command of her, thought fit to take what he wanted
of Mr Schweighauser's agent, to the amount of 31,668
livres, 12s. 3d., for which, being contrary to my orders
given to Mr Schweighauser, on his asking them upon the
occasion, I refused to pay, (my correspondence with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
will show you my reasons) and of those paid by the King
I have no account.</p>

<p><em>Question 9th.</em> "Why the Alliance lay so long at Port
L'Orient, after her arrival there from the Texel, and in
general every information in your power respecting the
Alliance and the expedition referred to?"</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> Her laying so long at L'Orient was first occasioned
by the mutinous disposition of the officers and
men, who refused to raise the anchors till they should
receive wages and prize money. I did not conceive they
had a right to demand payment of wages in a foreign
country, or anywhere but at the port they came from, no
one here knowing on what terms they were engaged, what
they had received, or what was due to them. The prize
money I wished them to have, but as that could not soon
be obtained, I thought it wrong in them to detain the
vessel on that account, and as I was informed many of
them were in want of necessaries, I advanced twentyfour
thousand livres on account, and put it into Captain Jones's
hands to relieve and pacify them, that they might go more
willingly. But they were encouraged by some meddling
passengers to persist. The King would have taken the
prizes and paid for them, at the rate <em>per gun, &amp;c</em>. as he
pays for warlike vessels taken by his ships, but they
raised a clamor at this, it being put into their heads, that it
was a project for cheating them, and they demanded a
sale by auction. The Minister, who usually gives more
when ships are taken for the King than they will produce
by auction, readily consented to this when I asked
it of him, but then this method required time to have
them inventoried, advertised in different ports, to create
a fuller concurrence of buyers, &amp;c. Captain Jones came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
up to Paris to hasten the proceedings. In his absence,
Captain Landais, by the advice of Mr Lee and Commodore
Gillon, took possession of the ship and kept her long,
writing up to Paris, waiting answers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have often mentioned to Congress the inconvenience
of putting their vessels under the care of persons living
perhaps one hundred leagues from the port they arrive
at, which necessarily creates delays, and of course enormous
expenses, and for a remedy I have as often recommended
the appointment of consuls, being very sensible
of my own insufficiency in maritime affairs, which have
taken up a vast deal of my time, and given me abundance
of trouble, to the hinderance, sometimes, of more
important business. I hope these inconveniences will now
be soon removed by the arrival of Mr Palfrey.</p>

<p>As the Ministry had reasons, if some of the first plans
had been pursued, to wish the expedition might be understood
as American, the instructions were to be given by
me, and the outfit was committed to Monsieur de Chaumont,
known to be one of our friends, and well acquainted
with such affairs. Monsieur le Marquis de Lafayette, who
was to have been concerned in the execution, can probably
acquaint you with those reasons. If not, I shall do it
hereafter. It afterwards continued in the hands of M. de
Chaumont to the end. I never paid or received a farthing
directly or indirectly on account of the expedition; and
the captains having made him their trustee and agent, it is
to him they are to apply for their proportions of the captures.
There may be something, though I believe very
little, coming to the United States from the Alliance's
share of a small ransom made contrary to orders.</p>

<p>No account has been rendered to me of that ransom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
therefore I cannot say how much, but I will inquire about
it and inform you hereafter.</p>

<p>Most of the colliers taken were burnt or sunk. The
ships of war taken, I understand belong wholly to the
captors. If any particulars remain, on which you desire
information, be pleased to mention them. I think it my
duty to give you all the satisfaction in my power, and shall
do it willingly.</p>

<p class="close">
Being with great regard, Gentlemen, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>AGREEMENT,</h3>

<p class="center"><em>Between Captain John Paul Jones and the Officers of
the Squadron.</em></p>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p>Agreement between Messieurs John Paul Jones, Captain
of the Bon Homme Richard; Pierre Landais, Captain
of the Alliance; Dennis Nicolas Cottineau, Captain of the
Pallas; Joseph Varage, Captain of the Stag; and Philip
Nicolas Ricot, Captain of the Vengeance; composing a
squadron, that shall be commanded by the oldest officer of
the highest grade, and so on in succession in case of death
or retreat. None of the said commanders, whilst they are
not separated from the said squadron, by order of the
Minister, shall act but by virtue of the brevet, which they
shall have obtained from the United States of America,
and it is agreed that the flag of the United States shall be
displayed.</p>

<p>The division of prizes to the superior officers and crews
of the said squadron, shall be made agreeably to the
American laws; but it is agreed, that the proportion of the
whole, coming to each vessel in the squadron, shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
regulated by the Minister of the Marine Department of
France, and the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United
States of America.</p>

<p>A copy of the American laws shall be annexed to the
present agreement, after having been certified by the commander
of the Bon Homme Richard; but as the said laws
cannot foresee nor determine as to what may concern the
vessels and subjects of other nations, it is expressly
agreed, that whatever may be contrary to them shall be
regulated by the Minister of the French Marine, and the
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America.</p>

<p>It is likewise agreed, that the orders given by the Minister
of the French Marine, and the Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States of America, shall be executed.</p>

<p>Considering the necessity there is of preserving the interests
of each individual, the prizes that shall be taken
shall be remitted to the orders of Monsieur le Ray de
Chaumont, Honorary Intendant of the Royal Hotel of Invalids,
who has furnished the expenses of the armament of
the said squadron.</p>

<p>It has been agreed, that M. le Ray de Chaumont be
requested not to give up the part of the prizes coming to
all the crews, and to each individual of the said squadron,
but to their order, and to be responsible for the same in his
own proper name.</p>

<p>Whereas the said squadron has been formed for the
purpose of injuring the common enemies of France and
America, it has been agreed that such armed vessels,
whether French or American, may be associated therewith,
as by common consent shall be found suitable for the
purpose, and that they shall have such proportion of the
prizes, which shall be taken, as the laws of their respective
countries allow them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>In case of the death of any one of the beforementioned
commanders of vessels, he shall be replaced
agreeably to the order of the tariff, with liberty, however,
to choose whether he will remain on board his own
vessel, and give up to the next in order the command
of the vacant ship.</p>

<p>It has moreover been agreed, that the commander of
the Stag shall be excepted from the last article of this
present agreement, because in case of a disaster to M.
de Varage, he shall be replaced by his second in command,
and so on by the other officers of his cutter, the
Stag.</p>

<h3>JAMES LOVELL TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
March 31st, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I send you a few newspapers, and the last monthly
journals which have come from the press. The enemy
will tell their own story of the naval engagement on the
16th. They have ventured nearer to truth in Rivington's
Royal Gazette than almost at any one time before, since
the very commencement of hostilities. Our allies conducted
most gallantly, and the enemy are so convinced of
the activity of the French commander, that they have not
ventured to remain in the Chesapeake Bay, to do all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
damage which the event of the battle had put in their
power.</p>

<p>I send you General Greene's account of an affair between
him and Cornwallis on the 15th. It differs but

Philadelphia, May 9th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Mr Samuel Curson and Mr Isaac Gouverneur, Jun. of
St Eustatia, after that place was taken, were sent to England
in the Vengeance man of war, Commodore Hotham,
stripped of everything but their wearing apparel; their
books, papers, and slaves having been taken from them,
and Mrs Gouverneur, with a young infant, turned out of
doors. Special severity, it is supposed, has been shown to
them in consequence of their acting as agents to Congress.
Doctor John Witherspoon, Jun. also, who was surgeon of
the De Graaff letter of marque, taken at St Eustatia, is
sent to England in the Alimena man of war, and very
hardly treated on account of his father being a member of
Congress, as is supposed.</p>

<p>Your particular attention to the exchange of these persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
will tend to give confidence to all, who being connected
specially with Congress are exposed to captivity,
and will also very particularly oblige the relations of these
unfortunates, who have requested Congress to mention
these circumstances to you.</p>

<h3>TO M. DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 14th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>You are a very good correspondent, which I do not deserve,
as I am a bad one. The truth is, I have too much
business upon my hands, a great deal of it foreign to my
function as a minister, which interferes with my writing
regularly to my friends. But I am nevertheless extremely
sensible of your kindness in sending me such frequent and
full intelligence of the state of affairs on your side of the
water, and in letting me see by your letters, that your
health continues, as well as your zeal for our cause and
country.</p>

<p>I hope, that by this time the ship, which has the honor
of bearing your name, is safely arrived. She carries clothing
for nearly twenty thousand men, with arms, ammunition,
&amp;c. which will supply some of your wants, and Colonel
Laurens will bring a considerable addition, if Providence
favors his passage. You will receive from him the particulars,
which makes my writing more fully by him unnecessary.</p>

<p>Your friends have heard of your being gone against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
traitor Arnold, and are anxious to hear of your success,
and that you have brought him to punishment. Enclosed
is a copy of a letter from his agent in England, captured
by one of our cruisers, and by which the price or reward
he received for his treachery may be guessed at. Judas
sold only one man, Arnold three millions. Judas got for
his one man thirty pieces of silver, Arnold not a halfpenny
a head. A miserable bargain! especially when one considers
the quantity of infamy he has acquired to himself,
and entailed on his family.</p>

<p>The English are in a fair way of gaining still more enemies;
they play a desperate game. Fortune may favor
them as it sometimes does a drunken dicer; but by their
tyranny in the East, they have at length roused the powers
there against them, and I do not know that they have in
the West a single friend. If they lose their India commerce,
(which is one of their present great supports,) and
one battle at sea, their credit is gone, and their power follows.
Thus empires, by pride, folly, and extravagance,
ruin themselves like individuals. M. de la Motte Piquet
has snatched from between their teeth a good deal of their
West India prey, having taken twentytwo sail of their
homeward bound prizes. One of our American privateers
has taken two more, and brought them into Brest, and two
were burnt; there were thirtyfour in company, with two
men of war of the line and two frigates, who saved themselves
by flight, but we do not hear of their being yet got
in.</p>

<p>I think it was a wise measure to send Colonel Laurens
here, who could speak knowingly of the state of the army.
It has been attended with all the success that perhaps
could reasonably be expected, though not with all that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
wished. He has fully justified your character of him, and
returns thoroughly possessed of my esteem; but that cannot
and ought not to please him so much, as a little more
money would have done for his beloved army. This Court
continues firm and steady in its friendship, and does everything
it can for us. Can we not do a little more for ourselves?
My successor (for I have desired the Congress
to send me one) will find it in the best disposition towards
us, and I hope he will take care to cultivate that disposition.
You, who know the leading people of both countries,
can perhaps judge better than any member of Congress
of a person suitable for this station. I wish you may
be in a way to give your advice, when the matter is agitated
in that assembly. I have been long tired of the trade
of minister, and wished for a little repose before I went to
sleep for good and all. I thought I might have held out
till the peace, but as that seems at a greater distance than
the end of my days, I grow impatient. I would not,
however, quit the service of the public, if I did not sincerely
think that it would be easy for the Congress, with
your counsel, to find a fitter man. God bless you, and
crown all your labors with success.</p>

<p>With the highest regard and most sincere affection, I
am, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 14th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I did myself the honor of writing to your Excellency
pretty fully on the 12th of March, to which I beg leave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
refer. Colonel Laurens arriving soon after, we renewed
the application for more money.</p>

<p>His indefatigable endeavors have brought the good dispositions
of this Court to a more speedy determination of
making an addition, than could well have been expected
so soon after the former grant. As he will have an opportunity
of acquainting you personally with all the particulars
of importance, a circumstantial account of the transaction
from me is unnecessary. I would only mention, that as it
is the practice here to consider early in the year the probable
expenses of the campaign, and appropriate the revenues
to the several necessary services, all subsequent and
unexpected demands are extremely inconvenient and disagreeable,
as they cannot be answered without difficulty,
occasion much embarrassment, and are sometimes impracticable.
If, therefore, the Congress have not on this occasion
obtained all they wished, they will impute it to the right
cause, and not suppose a want of good will in our friends,
who indeed are such, most firmly and sincerely.</p>

<p>The whole supply for the current year now amounts to
twenty millions; but out of this are to be paid your usual
drafts for interest money, those in favor of M. de Beaumarchais,
and those heretofore drawn on Mr Jay and Mr
Laurens, which I have already either paid or engaged for,
with the support of your several Ministers, &amp;c. &amp;c. which
I mention, that the Congress may avoid embarrassing my
successor with drafts, which perhaps he may not have
the means in his hands of honoring. Besides paying the
second year's salaries of Messrs Adams and Dana, Jay
and Carmichael, I have furnished Mr Dana with £1,500
sterling credit on Petersburgh, for which place I suppose
he is now on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>You will receive from Holland advices of the late declaration
of that Court, with regard to the English refusal
of its mediation, and of the assistance requested by the
States-General. I hope Mr Dana will find it well disposed
towards us.</p>

<p>I have received no answer yet to my letters relating to
the proposed mode of lodging funds here, by supplying the
French fleet and army. Having as yet heard nothing of
Colonel Palfrey, and it being now more than four months
since he sailed, there is great reason to fear he may be
lost. If that should unhappily be the case, the Congress
cannot too soon appoint another consul, such an officer
being really necessary here. Your Minister Plenipotentiary
has hitherto had all that sort of business upon his
hands, and as I do not now speak for myself, I may speak
more freely, I think he should be freed from the burden of
such affairs, from all concerns in making contracts for furnishing
supplies, and from all your bill of exchange business,
&amp;c. &amp;c. that he may be more at liberty to attend to
the duties of his political function.</p>

<p>The prisoners in England are increasing by the late
practice of sending our people from New York, and the
refusal of the English Admiralty to exchange any Americans
for Englishmen not taken by American armed vessels.
I would mention it for the consideration of Congress,
whether it may not be well to set apart five or six hundred
English prisoners, and refuse them all exchange in
America, but for our countrymen now confined in England.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the vote of Congress, and your Excellency's
letter of the 4th of January, I have requested the assistance
of this Court for obtaining the release of Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
President Laurens. It does not yet appear that the thing
is practicable. What the present situation is of that unfortunate
gentleman, may be gathered from the enclosed
letters.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>I hope the Alliance, with the ship <em>Marquis de Lafayette</em>
under her convoy, is by this time arrived, as they sailed
the 27th of March. I flatter myself that the supplies of
clothing, &amp;c. which they carry, will be found good of the
kind, and well bought. I have by several late opportunities
sent copies of the government letters taken in the New
York packet. Your Excellency will see, that they are
written in the perfect persuasion of our submitting speedily,
and that the Commissioners are cautioned not to promise
too much, with regard to the future constitutions to be
given us, as many changes of the old may be necessary,
&amp;c. One cannot read those letters from the American
Secretary of State, and his Under-Secretary, Knox, without
a variety of reflections on the state we should necessarily
be in, if obliged to make the submission they so fondly
hope for, but which I trust in God they will never see.
Their affairs in the East Indies, by the late accounts, grow
worse and worse; and twentytwo ships of the prey they
made in the West are wrenched out of their jaws by the
squadron of M. de la Motte Piquet.</p>

<p>I mentioned in a former letter, my purpose of remaining
here for some time after I should be superseded. I mean
it with the permission of Congress, and on the supposition
of no orders being sent me to the contrary; and I hope it
will be so understood.</p>

With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THOMAS LEWIS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 16th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter you did me the honor of writing
to me the 1st of January. The bill for four thousand
four hundred and fortyfour Mexican dollars, which you
remitted to Mr Schweighauser, being refused payment by
Mr Jay, for want of a regular endorsement by Mr Laurens,
in whose favor it was drawn, and which endorsement
could not now be obtained, Mr Schweighauser
applied to me, informing me that he should not send the
things ordered by your Board, unless the bill was paid;
and it appearing on the face of the bill, that it was drawn
for public service, I concluded to take it up, on which
he has purchased the things and shipped them. Colonel
Laurens has put on board some other supplies for the
army, and I suppose she will now sail directly.</p>

<p>The drafts from Congress upon me for various services,
and those on Mr Jay and Mr Laurens, all coming upon
me for payment, together with the expenses on the ships,
&amp;c. &amp;c. have made it impracticable for me to advance
more for loading the Active; but as we have obtained
lately promises of a considerable aid for this year, I shall
now try what I can do, as the money comes in, towards
supplying what is demanded in the invoice you mention.
You will receive, I hope, twentyeight cannon, and a large
quantity of powder and saltpetre, by the ship Marquis de
Lafayette.</p>

<p>I have by several opportunities written in answer to your
questions relative to the ship Alliance.</p>

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Versailles, June 8th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter you did me the honor to write
me on the 4th instant. I do not know whether Mr Laurens
has purchased the clothing in Holland on account of Congress;
I only know (and you were likewise informed of it
at the same time) that this officer was <em>to employ for his
purchases in France</em> part of the six millions, which the
King has granted to Congress, and that the residue of this
sum was intended to be sent to America, with a view of
re-establishing the credit of the United States.</p>

<p>If Mr Laurens, instead of paying ready money in Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
has contented himself with giving bills on you, I have
no concern in it, and the King can furnish no means for
your reimbursement.</p>

<p>As to the monies arising from the loan opened in Holland,
we have no pretensions to regulate the employment
of them, as they belong to the United States. You must,
therefore, Sir, apply to Congress for the power of disposing
of them, in discharge of the drafts drawn on you

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have lately done myself the honor of writing largely to
your Excellency by divers conveyances, to which I beg
leave to refer. This is chiefly to cover the copy of a letter
I have just received from the Minister, relative to the disposition
of the late loans, by which will be seen the situation
I am in with respect to my acceptances of the
quantities of bills drawn by Congress on Mr Jay, Mr Laurens,
Mr Adams, and myself, which I entered into, in the
expectation, which both Colonel Laurens and myself entertained,
that a part of these loans might be applied to the
payment of these bills, but which I am now told cannot
be done without an express order from Congress.</p>

<p>I shall endeavor to change the sentiments of the Court
in this respect, but I am not sure of succeeding. I must
therefore request that a resolution of Congress may immediately
be sent, empowering me to apply as much of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

<h3>TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 11th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Mr Grand has communicated to me a letter from your
Excellency to him, relating to certain charges in your
account, on which you seem to desire to have my opinion.
As we are all new in these matters, I consulted,
when I was making up my account, one of the oldest
foreign Ministers here, as to the custom in such cases.
He informed me, that it was not perfectly uniform with
the Ministers of all Courts, but that in general, where a
salary was given for service and expenses, the expenses
understood were merely those necessary to the man, such
as housekeeping, clothing, and coach; but that the rent
of the hotel in which he dwelt, the payment of couriers,
the postage of letters, the salary of clerks, the stationary
for his bureau, with the feasts and illuminations made on
public occasions, were esteemed the expenses of the
Prince, or State that appointed him, being for the service
or honor of his Prince or nation; and either entirely, or in
great part, expenses that, as a private man, he would have
been under no necessity of incurring. These, therefore,
were to be charged in his accounts. He remarked, it was
true that the Minister's housekeeping as well as his house
was usually, and in some sort necessarily more expensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
than those of a private person, but this he said was considered
in his salary to avoid trouble in accounts; but
that where the Prince or State had not purchased or built
a house for their Minister, which was sometimes the case,
they always paid his house rent.</p>

<p>I have stated my own accounts according to this information;
and I mention them, that if they seem to you
reasonable, we may be uniform in our charges, by your
charging in the same manner; or if objections to any of
them occur to you, that you would communicate them to
me for the same reason.</p>

<p>Thus you see my opinion, that the articles you mention
of courtage, commission, and port de lettres, are
expenses that ought to be borne, not by you, but by the
United States. Yet it seems to me more proper, that you
should pay them, and charge them with the other articles
abovementioned, than that they should be paid by me,
who, not knowing the circumstances, cannot judge (as you
can) of the truth or justice of such an account when presented,
and who, besides, have no orders to pay more on
your account, than your net salary.</p>

<p>With regard to that salary, though your receipts to
Fitzeaux and Grand, shown to me, might be quite sufficient
to prove they had paid you the sums therein mentioned,
yet, as there are vouchers for them, and which
they have a right to retain, I imagine it will be clearest, if
you draw upon me, agreeably to the order of Congress,
and if this is quarterly, it will be the most convenient to me.</p>

<p>Congress have received your letter of the 12th of March

being soon opened in Europe, under the mediation
of the imperial Courts of Petersburgh and Vienna, for accommodating
the disputes between the belligerent powers,

these United States, has determined us to increase the
number of our ministers for negotiating a peace with Great
Britain. We have, therefore, added yourself, Messrs Jay,
H. Laurens, and Thomas Jefferson to Mr Adams, to repair
to such place as shall be fixed on for transacting this
important business.</p>

<p>A compliance with your request to retire from public
employment would be inconvenient at this particular juncture,
as it is the desire of Congress to avail themselves
of your abilities and experience at the approaching negotiation.
Should you find repose necessary after rendering
the United States this further service, Congress, in consideration
of your age and bodily infirmities, will be disposed
to gratify your inclination.</p>

<p>You will present the letter to His Most Christian Majesty,

that he would make no difficulty of giving it, if you assured

of the 28th ult. while at the Texel, superintending some
matters relating to the ship. Equally concerned for the
cause, as surprised at the manner in which Mr Fizeaux was
resolved to execute it, in case the money had been already
shipped, I must beg leave to inform you fully of this business,
and to request your Excellency's final determination
thereon.</p>

<p>Colonel Laurens, as your Excellency knows, was sent
by Congress to the Court of Versailles, with a special commission;
the purport of his mission you are well acquainted
with; it was to obtain certain supplies in specie and military
stores.</p>

<p>By the most unremitting assiduity, he so far succeeded
as to procure, amongst others, a sum of money to be shipped
in Holland by the South Carolina frigate, which was
deemed, by the Court of France, a safe and convenient
conveyance, as it would divide the risk which must have
been incurred by placing the whole on board of one vessel.
That sum was sent to this place by M. Necker, and lodged
in the house of Fizeaux and Grand, to be by them delivered
to me, agreeably to the following order, the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

of this supply being sent from Europe; however
much I may regret Colonel Laurens's absence which induces
it, I shall possess the pleasing reflection of having
done my duty, in demanding, conformably to the intentions
of M. Necker, and by his order, that money which
the Court of France had accorded to the United States by
the application of Colonel Laurens, in virtue of his special
commission, and which was particularly and expressly destined
to reanimate the credit of the continental currency.</p>

<p>The ship waits for nothing else but this money. I shall
attend your Excellency's ultimate decision thereon, which
I expect to receive by return of the express, who only
waits your commands.</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> M Fizeaux informed me that he had resolved
to arrest the ship, had the money been on board, I need
not inform your Excellency that a like opportunity may
not again offer to transport this essential supply, rendered
still more so by the capture of the ship Marquis de Lafayette.</p>

<h3>MAJOR WILLIAM JACKSON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, July 2d, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Since the departure of my express, I find myself obliged,
in conformity to Colonel Laurens's instructions (from
which, as his agent I cannot recede, unless compelled
thereto by forcible means, and which unless such are practised
against me, I must carry into execution) to retain the
money, which he has confided to my care, and which the
Minister of Finance's order makes deliverable to me specially;
and to arrest it in the hands of M. Fizeaux, should
he continue to refuse the delivery of it but by your Excellency's
orders.</p>

<p>I rely upon your Excellency's attachment to the welfare
of America, to prevent this painful operation, which must
inevitably take place should your determination decide
otherwise, for as this money is subject to no other control
in Europe, but the immediate order of the Court of
France, I cannot relinquish my charge of it, but by their
special order.</p>

<h3>MAJOR WILLIAM JACKSON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, July 2d, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Your Excellency will not wonder at the determination
which I have adopted, to arrest the money now in M.
Fizeaux's hands, (and which I have communicated to you
by a second express this afternoon) when you reflect, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
this money is absolutely committed to my charge for a
special purpose, and that I stand accountable for the execution
of this commission. Your Excellency must likewise
be sensible, that you cannot have the disposal of it, as it
was obtained without either your knowledge or concurrence
by Colonel Laurens, appointed special Minister for
that purpose. These considerations, and the knowledge I
have how much America must suffer from a disappointment
in this supply, about to be transported by so excellent
a conveyance, must plead my excuse individually for this
plain and candid avowal of circumstances, and my determination
thereon. I am further persuaded, that the Court
of France is not disposed, was there even a shadow of an
excuse for an alteration of the allotment of this money, to
infringe their honor and injure the essential interests of
America by detaining it. I must therefore again entreat
your Excellency's repeal of those orders to M. Fizeaux,
which now detain the ship and supplies so much required
in America.</p>

<h3>TO MAJOR WILLIAM JACKSON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 5th, 1781, at 6 in the morning.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have this, instant received your letter of the 2d, urging
the delivery of the money. I must be short in my reply,
as your express waits.</p>

<p>Colonel Laurens indeed obtained a promise of ten millions,
to be raised by a loan in Holland. I understood
while he was here, that that loan was in train, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
million and a half to be sent with you was a part of it. I
since learn, that nothing has yet been obtained in Holland,
that the success is not yet certain, and that the money in
question is a part of the six millions I had obtained before
his arrival, upon the strength of which I accepted the bills
drawn on his father, and on Mr Jay, and without which
acceptances the Congress' credit in America would have
been ruined, and a loss incurred of twenty per cent upon
the protests. I cannot obtain more money here at present,
and those bills being accepted must be paid, as well as
those I accepted on your earnest request, for the great
unexpected purchase you made in Holland.</p>

<p>Colonel Laurens has carried two millions and a half of
that six millions with him, which will serve till the loan in
Holland produces a further supply. In the meantime I
cannot suffer the credit of our country to be destroyed, if
by detaining this money it may be saved. And if I were
to consent to its going, our banker would be obliged to
arrest great part of it as belonging to the States, he being in
advance for them, which would occasion much disagreeable
noise, and very ill consequences to our credit in Europe.</p>

<p>I find by Mr Viemerange's account just received, that
Mr Laurens's orders have more than absorbed all the money
he did not take with him. I applaud the zeal you have
both shown in the affair, but I see, that nobody cares how
much I am distressed, provided they can carry their own
points. I must, therefore, take what care I can of mine,
theirs and mine being equally intended for the service of
the public. I am sorry to learn, that the vessel is detained
for this express. I understood by your last, that she waited
for convoy. I heartily wish you a good voyage, and am, with
great esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO MAJOR WILLIAM JACKSON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 6th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received and answered two of your expresses yesterday
morning, and in the evening I received a third letter
from you, all dated the 2d instant.</p>

<p>In this last you tell me, "that I must be sensible I cannot
have the disposal of the money, as it was obtained
without either my knowledge or concurrence, by Colonel
Laurens, appointed special Minister for that purpose." I
do not desire to diminish the merit of Colonel Laurens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
I believe he would have been glad, if it had been in his
power to have procured ten times the sum; and that no
application or industry on his part for that purpose would
have been wanting. But I cannot let this injurious assertion
of yours pass, without expressing my surprise, that
you, who were always with that gentleman, should be so
totally ignorant of that transaction. The six millions, of
which he took with him two and a half, of which one and
a half were sent to Holland, and of which more than the
remainder is ordered in stores from hence, was a <em>free gift</em>
from the King's goodness (not a <em>loan</em> to be <em>repaid with
interest</em>,) and was obtained by <em>my application</em>, long before
Colonel Laurens's arrival.</p>

<p>I had also given in a list of the stores to be provided,
though on his coming I cheerfully gave up the further prosecution
of that business into his hands, as he was better
acquainted with the particular wants of the army, than I
could be, and it was one of the purposes of his appointment.</p>

<p>Thus no part of the affair was done without my "<em>knowledge
and concurrence</em>," except the sending a million and a
half of the specie to Holland. This was indeed a secret
to me. I had heard of that sum's being ready there to
embark, but I always till lately understood it to be a part of
the Dutch loan, which I am about to mention, or I should
certainly have opposed that operation. What Colonel
Laurens really obtained, and a great service I hope it will
prove, was a loan upon interest of ten millions, to be borrowed
on the credit of this Court in Holland. I have not
heard, that this loan has yet produced anything, and,
therefore, I do not know that a single livre exists, or has
existed in Europe, of his procuring for the States. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the contrary, he and you have drawn from me considerable
sums, as necessary for your expenses, and he left me near
forty thousand livres to pay for the Alliance, and, moreover,
engaged me in a debt in Holland, which I understood
might amount to about fifteen thousand pounds sterling,
and which you contrived to make fifty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>When I mentioned to him the difficulty I should find to
pay the drafts, he said, you have the remainder of the six
millions. He gave me no account of the dispositions he
had made, and it is but lately I have learnt that there is
no remainder. To gratify you, and to get that ship out,
which could not have stirred without me, I have engaged
for the vast sum abovementioned, which I am sure I shall
be much distressed to pay, and therefore have not deserved
at your hands the affront you are advised to menace
me with.</p>

<p>And since I find you make it a point of reflection upon
me, that I want to apply money to the payment of my engagements
for the Congress, which was obtained by Colonel
Laurens for other purposes, I must request, that you will
upon this better information take occasion to correct that
error, if you have communicated it to any other person.</p>

<p>By the letters you showed me, that had passed between
Mr Adams and you, I perceived he had imbibed an opinion,
that Colonel Laurens had, as he expressed it, done
more for the United States in the short time of his being
in Europe, than all the rest of their Diplomatic Corps
put together. I should never have disputed this, because
I had rather lend a little credit to a friend, than take
any from him, especially when I am persuaded he will
make a good use of it; but when his friends will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
such suppositious credit a matter of reproach to me, it is
not right to continue silent.</p>

<p>As to the safety of the excellent conveyance you mention,
I must own, I have some doubts about it, and I fear
I shall hear of the arrival of that ship in England, before
she sees America. Be that as it may, I am clear that no
use can possibly be made of the money in America for
supporting the credit of the States, equal in any degree to
the effect it must have for the same purpose, when applied
to the payment of their bills here, which must otherwise
go back protested. And I am sure it will be exceedingly
prejudicial to their credit, if by the rash proceeding you
threaten, this situation of their affairs becomes the subject
of public talk and discussion in Europe.</p>

I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 11th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The number of Congress bills that have been drawn on
the Ministers in Spain and Holland, which I am by my acceptances
obliged to pay, as well as those drawn upon
myself, the extreme importance of supporting the credit of
Congress, which would be disgraced in a political, as well
as a pecuniary light, through all the Courts of Europe, if
those bills should go back protested, and the unexpected
delays arising with regard to the intended loan in Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
all those considerations have compelled me to stop the one
million five hundred thousand livres, which were to have
been sent by way of Amsterdam. As soon as more
money can be furnished to me by this Court, I shall take
care to replace that sum, and forward with it as great an
addition as possible. I am now soliciting supplies of
clothing, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. to replace what has been
unfortunately lost in the Marquis de Lafayette; and hope
to succeed.</p>

<p>Captain Jackson, who is truly zealous for the service,
has been exceedingly solicitous and earnest with me to
induce me to permit the money to go in this ship, but for
the reasons abovementioned, I find it absolutely necessary
to retain it for the present, which I doubt not will be approved
by Congress.</p>

<h3>TO C. W. F. DUMAS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, August 6th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received several letters from you lately, enclosing
others for the President of Congress, and for
Spain, all of which are sealed and forwarded, except the
last for the President, contained in yours of the 26th past,
which shall go by the first opportunity. The reading of
those letters gave me much information, and therefore
pleasure; though since the fixing of Mr Adams there I
do not attend so much to the affairs of your country as
before, expecting indeed but little from it to our advantage;
for though it was formerly in the same situation with
us, and was glad of assistance from other nations, it does
not seem to <em>feel</em> for us, or to have the least inclination to
help us; it appears to want magnanimity.</p>

<p>Some writer, I forget who, says, that Holland is no
longer a <em>nation</em>, but <em>a great shop</em>; and I begin to think it
has no other principles or sentiments but those of a shopkeeper.
You can judge of it better than I, and I shall be
happy to find myself mistaken. You will oblige me, however,
by continuing the history either directly to me, or in
your letters to Congress; but when you enclose a sealed
letter in another to me, please to observe to place the
second seal on one side, and not directly over the first;
because the heat of the second is apt to deface the impression
of the first, and to attach the paper to it, so as to
endanger tearing the enclosed in opening the cover.</p>

<p>With best wishes for your health and prosperity, I am
ever, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> I pity the writer of the enclosed, though I have
no other acquaintance with him, than having seen him
once at Hanover, where he then seemed to live genteely
and in good credit. I cannot conceive what should reduce
him to such a situation, as to engage himself for a
soldier. If you can procure him any friends among the
philosophers of your country, capable of relieving him, I
wish you could do it. If not, and he must go to the
Indies, please to give him three or four guineas for me, to
buy a few necessaries for his voyage.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Enclosed I send you a late paper received from Rhode

gained in South Carolina. Late advices directly from
Philadelphia say, that the enemy have now nothing left in
Georgia, but Savannah; in South Carolina, but Charleston;
nor in North Carolina, but Wilmington. They are,
however, in force in Virginia, where M. de Lafayette has
not sufficient strength to oppose them, till the arrival of
the reinforcements, which were on their march to join
him from Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In looking over my last to you, I apprehend I may have
expressed myself perhaps a little too hardly of your country;
I foresee you will tell me that we have many friends
there; I once thought so too; but I was a little out of
humor when I wrote, on understanding that no loan could
be obtained there for our use, though the credit of this
kingdom was offered to be engaged for assuring the payment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, September 13th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I duly received the two letters your Excellency did me
the honor of writing to me, both dated the 19th of June,
together with the letter addressed to the King and the
three Commissioners, with the instructions relative to the
negotiations for peace. I immediately went to Versailles
and presented the letter, which was graciously received.
I communicated also to Count de Vergennes a copy of
your instructions after having decyphered them. He read
them while I was with him, and expressed his satisfaction
with the unreserved confidence placed in his Court by
the Congress, assuring me that they never would have
cause to regret it, for that the King had the honor of the
United States at heart, as well as their welfare and independence.
Indeed this has already been manifested in
the negotiations relative to the Plenipotentiaries, and I
have had so much experience of His Majesty's goodness to
us, in the aids afforded us from time to time, and of the
sincerity of this upright and able Minister, who never
promised me anything which he did not punctually perform,
that I cannot but think the confidence well and judiciously
placed, and that it will have happy effects.</p>

<p>I have communicated to Mr Adams and to Mr Jay
the purport of your despatches. Mr Adams already had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
received the same; by the first safe conveyance I shall
acquaint the Congress with the steps that have been
taken in the negotiation. At present I would only say,
that the settling of preliminaries meets with difficulty, and
will probably take much time, partly from the remoteness
of the mediators, so that any relaxation of our warlike
preparations in expectation of a speedy peace, will be
imprudent as it may be pernicious.</p>

<p>I am extremely sensible of the honor done me by the
Congress in this new appointment. I beg they would
accept my thankful acknowledgments; and since they
judge I may be serviceable, though I had requested leave
to retire, I submit dutifully to their determination, and
shall do my utmost to merit in some degree the favorable
opinion they appear to have of me. I am the more
encouraged in this resolution, as within the last three
months I find my health and strength considerably re-established.</p>

<p>I wish, however, that a consul general may soon be appointed
for this kingdom; it would ease me of abundance
of troublesome business to which I am not equal, and
which interferes with my own important functions.</p>

<p>The King having graciously complied with my request,
of replacing the supplies lost in the Marquis de Lafayette,
many hands are employed in providing them, who work
hard to have them ready and shipped, so that they
may arrive before winter.</p>

<p>With the highest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, October 20th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Congress having lately thought it advisable to alter the
arrangement of their great executive departments, and to
dissolve the Boards and Committees under whose direction
they formerly were, I am to inform you, that they have
done me the honor to appoint me their Secretary of Foreign
Affairs; in which capacity they have made it my
duty, as it will always be my inclination, to maintain an
intimate and regular correspondence with you. I have
this day taken the oaths of office, and as the recital of fortunate
events is the most pleasing task annexed to it, I
shall give you a short sketch of the state of our military
operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>When General Washington was fully apprized, that
Count de Grasse was to visit this Continent, he made
every provision for the attack of New York, where the enemy
had about six thousand troops, and seven ships of
the line, which were thought inadequate to its defence.
He collected the troops, as well those of allies as our own,
and made a movement towards New York. The delay of
our recruits in coming in, a small reinforcement to the
enemy from Europe, and some other circumstances, gave
us reason to be apprehensive for the event of this attempt,
though the magnitude of the object still urged the General
to undertake it. It was the enemy's place of arms, the
repository of their magazines, and the only harbor for large
ships left them on this side of Halifax. Every preparation
was accordingly made, when some circumstances deemed
unfortunate at the time, but which like many others of our
supposed evils have in the end been productive of good,
occasioned an alteration in the destination of Count de
Grasse. He sailed for the Chesapeake. The General
still appearing to prosecute his first design moved his army,
and made such preparations as induced the enemy to believe,
that he meant to possess himself of Staten Island,
as preparatory to his design upon New York.</p>

<p>In the meantime the army filed off through Hackensack
and Newark, to keep up the deception, and arrived by
expeditious marches at the head of the Elk. Count de
Grasse arrived at the critical moment, and Cornwallis, at
the head of about seven thousand men, found himself
completely invested at Yorktown by an army of near fourteen
thousand regular troops. The British fleet, which
arrived at New York about the time that Count de Grasse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
reached the Chesapeake, made an ineffectual attempt to
relieve their army. They were defeated and compelled to
return to New York, after losing the Terrible, a seventyfour,
and two frigates; by which means, a junction of the
fleet from Rhode Island was formed with that under the
Count de Grasse. It arrived the day after the action, and
narrowly escaped falling in with the English fleet.</p>

<p>Our batteries were opened on the 7th. The enemy having
evacuated their principal outworks and been repulsed
in one or two sallies, our second parallel was begun on the
11th, within three hundred yards of their lines, and the
least sanguine among the officers fix the end of the month
as the era of Cornwallis's captivity. His whole force at
York, and on the opposite side of the river, including
seamen and regulars, amounts to about seven thousand
men.</p>

<p>The enemy sailed from Sandy Hook yesterday, with
twentythree ships of the line, and three fiftys, with several
frigates, and a number of fire ships. They have nine
thousand of their best troops, if we are rightly informed,
on board their ships of war. They are resolved to make
some attempt for the relief of Cornwallis, whose capture
must draw after it the loss of all the posts they hold in the
Southern States, and the total ruin of their affairs in
America. Georgia has re-established her government,
where the enemy have no other footing than in Savannah.
South Carolina is about doing the same. General Greene
has very prudently wasted the strength of the enemy,
and raised the confidence of the militia, by fighting them
in detail. His late victory, which I enclose you an account
of, in his own words, affords the most promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
prospect of speedily recovering the possession of that
country.</p>

<p>Congress are, however, looking forward to another campaign.
They have voted twentyfive thousand men for the
ensuing year. These, when raised and appointed, together
with the success which has hitherto, and which we
may promise ourselves will still continue to attend the allied
arms, will enable you to open your diplomatic campaign
with great advantage, and permit you, Sir, to rejoice
in the close of that great work, to which you have so sedulously
and ably contributed.</p>

<p>I need not tell you, Sir, how anxious I shall be to hear
from you on every occasion. Nothing short of the most
constant and regular information will satisfy the expectations
of Congress. We have much to learn, and but few
opportunities of acquiring information. Your situation
enables you not only to let us know what passes with you,
but to extend your inquiries to Courts where we have no
Ministers, and of whose politics we would not choose to be
ignorant, though they may but remotely concern us at
present. For my own part, I freely confess, that I rely
much upon your knowledge and experience to supply my
want of both.</p>

<p>I propose to write so frequently to you as to keep you
fully informed, not only of what is, but of what is not
done, since the last may sometimes be as important to
you as the first.</p>

<p>As far, Sir, as you may find a similar task consistent
with your health, your leisure, and your various avocations,
you will render us essential services in imposing it
upon yourself.</p>

<p>Congress having resolved, that all communications with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
their Ministers abroad, shall pass through this office, you

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, October 24th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I three days since did myself the honor to write to
you, informing you of my appointment to the Secretaryship
of Foreign Affairs; and preparing you for the happy
event which has taken place. Enclosed you have the
capitulation of Yorktown and Gloucester, by which a
British army of 5600 men was surrendered to the allied
arms of France and America; and no inconsiderable fleet,
with 800 seamen, to the navy of His Most Christian
Majesty.</p>

<p>Since my last, which was written the day after I entered
upon office, I have seen yours of the 14th of May. There
are many things in it which deserve the attention I mean
to pay it, when the first hurry that the intelligence I communicate
occasions is over. But, Sir, there is a part
which I cannot delay to take notice of, because I feel myself
interested in opposing the resolution that you seem to
have formed of quitting the station, which, for the honor
of the United States, you now hold. I shall be impatient
till I hear, that you comply with the wishes of Congress on
this subject, as communicated long since. Though the
new powers with which you are invested impose additional
burthens upon you, yet as they at once contain the amplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
testimonials of the approbation of Congress, and directly
lead to the completion of the great cause in which
you so early engaged, I cannot but flatter myself that you
will take it upon you. I sent with my first letter to you
one to the Count de Vergennes, informing him of my
appointment. You will do me the honor to present it.</p>

<p class="close">
I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THOMAS MC'KEAN, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, November 5th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Herewith you will receive a copy of my last; since
which I have been honored with two letters from the late
President, the one dated March 2d, relating to Captain
Jones's cross of merit, which I have communicated as
directed; the other, dated July 5th, respecting the release
and exchange of Mr Laurens.</p>

<p>Having no direct communication with the British Ministers,
and Mr Burke appearing, by a letter to me, warmly
interested in favor of his friend, General Burgoyne, to
prevent his being recalled I have requested and empowered
him to negotiate that exchange, and I soon expect his
answer. The late practice of sending to England prisoners
taken in America, has greatly augmented the number
of those unfortunate men, and proportionally increased the
expense of relieving them. The subscriptions for that
purpose in England have ceased. The allowance I have
made to them of sixpence each per week during the summer,
though small, amounts to a considerable sum; and
during the winter, I shall be obliged to double, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
treble it. The Admiralty there will not accept any English
in exchange, but such as have been taken by Americans,
and absolutely refuse to allow any of the paroles
given to our privateers by English prisoners discharged at
sea, except in one instance, that of fiftythree men taken in
the Snake sloop, by the Pilgrim and Rambler, which was
a case attended, as they say, with some particular circumstances.
I know not what the circumstances were, but
shall be glad to see the fiftythree of our people, whom they
promised to send me by the first cartel. I have above
five hundred other paroles solemnly given in writing, by
which the Englishmen promised either to send our people
in exchange, or to surrender themselves to me in France,
not one of which has been regarded, so little faith and
honor remain in that corrupted nation. Our privateers,
when in the European seas, will rarely bring in their prisoners
when they can get rid of them at sea. Some of
our poor brave countrymen have been in that cruel captivity
now near four years. I hope the Congress will take
this matter into immediate consideration, and find some
means for their deliverance, and to prevent the sending
more from America. By my last accounts, the number now
in the several prisons amounts to upwards of eight hundred.</p>

<p>I request also some direction from Congress (having
never received any) respecting the allowance to be made
to them while they remain there. They complain that
the food given them is insufficient. Their petition to the
English government to have an equal allowance with the
French and Spanish prisoners has been rejected, which
makes the small pecuniary assistance I can send them
more necessary. If a certain number of English prisoners
could be set apart in America, treated exactly in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
manner, and their exchange refused till it should be agreed
to set these at liberty in Europe, one might hope to succeed
in procuring the discharge of our people. Those,
who escape and pass through France to get home, put me
also to a great expense for their land journies, which could
be prevented if they could be exchanged, as they would
be landed here in ports.</p>

<p>The Ambassador of Venice told me, that he was
charged by the senate to express to me their grateful
sense of the friendly behavior of Captain Barry, commander
of the Alliance, in rescuing one of the ships of
their State from an English privateer, and setting her at
liberty; and he requested me to communicate this acknowledgment
to Congress. There is a complaint from
Holland against Captain Jones, for having taken the brigantine
Berkenbosch and sending her to America, and I
have been desired to lay before Congress the enclosed depositions
relating to that capture, and to request their
attention to it.</p>

<p>The Ambassador of Portugal also frequently asks me if
I have received any answer to their complaint, long since
sent over. I wish it was in my power to give one of some
kind or other. But none has yet come to my hands. I
need not mention the importance of attending to the smallest
complaints between nations, the neglect of them having
sometimes very serious consequences.</p>

<p>The mediation proposed is not agreed to by England,
who refuses to treat with our United States but as a Sovereign
with subjects, and I apprehend that a change in that
resolution is only to be expected from time, the growing
insupportable expense of the war, or a course of misfortunes
in the progress of it. The spirits of that nation have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
been continually kept up by the flattering accounts sent
over, of our being weary of the contest, and on the point
of submission. Their Ministers, as appears by their intercepted
letters, have been themselves so far deceived as to
expect daily those submissions, and to have the pleasure of
laying them before the King. We may, perhaps, be able
to guess a little by the King's speech at the approaching
new session of Parliament, whether they still continue
under this delusion. As long as it subsists peace is not
to be expected.</p>

<p>A loan has been proposed to be obtained for us of the
States of Holland on the credit of this government. All
public operations are slow in that country, and though the
affair is at length said to be concluded, it is not yet executed.
Considerable advances have, however, been made
here in expectation of being reimbursed by it. The
last aids granted us have been so absorbed by my payment
of the drafts on Mr Jay and Mr Adams, and acceptance
of those for the enormous unexpected purchases in
Holland, which were to have gone in Captain Gillon's
ship, but left behind, that I shall have nothing to spare for
extraordinaries, unless some of the Holland loan comes
soon into my hands. I am now told from Amsterdam,
that the two ships freighted there to carry those goods are
detained, as their contract was to sail under convoy of the
South Carolina, which left them; and they must now take
more men to defend them, and of consequence claim a
higher freight, and to have it paid before they sail, unless I
will buy the ships, and send them on account of Congress,
neither of which is in my power to do. It was with reluctance
I engaged in that affair, having little confidence in
Captain Gillon's management, and fearing some embarrassment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of our credit. I consented in fine to engage for the
payment of ten thousand pounds sterling, being the value of
the goods suitable for Congress, said to be already shipped
in that vessel, and as there was said to be still some room,
and she was thought a safe conveyance, I concluded to
furnish an additional sum to fill that supposed vacancy,
which I limited to five thousand pounds sterling more.
You will judge of my surprise, when I saw the accounts of
that additional purchase, which amounted, instead of five,
to fifty thousand pounds sterling. I at first absolutely refused
to pay for them. But Captain Jackson came to me
from thence express, urged that the purchase was made
by order of Colonel Laurens; that the goods were on
board; that if I would not undertake to pay for them,
they must be relanded, and returned or sold, which would
be a public disgrace to us; that they were all articles exceedingly
wanted in America, &amp;c. &amp;c. In fine, I was
prevailed on, and accepted the bills, and was obliged to
go with this after-clap to the Ministers, a proceeding
always disagreeable, after the dispositions of the funds of
the year have been arranged; and more so in this case, as
the money was to be paid for the manufactures of other
countries, and not laid out in those of this kingdom, by
whose friendship it was furnished. This fresh grant was
at first absolutely refused; at length I obtained it, and I
hoped the difficulty was over.</p>

<p>But after all, the officers declare the ship was overloaded,
that there was not room to lodge the people and
provisions, nor to act in fighting her; the goods are turned
out into two other ships, those are left, and it is now proposed
to me, either to buy them, or to advance a freight
nearly equal to their value. I cannot make a new demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
for this purpose; and I shall not wonder if this government,
observing how badly our shipping and transporting
the supplies are managed, should take that business for the
future entirely into their own hands, as they have begun to
do in the case of replacing the cargo of the Marquis de
Lafayette, and indeed, till some active, intelligent person,
skilled in maritime affairs, is placed here as consul, I cannot
but think it will be much better executed, and more
for our advantage. Some considerable parts of that new
cargo are already shipped, and the rest I hear are in great
forwardness.</p>

<p>The very friendly disposition of this Court towards us
still continues, and will, I hope, continue forever. From
my own inclination, as well as in obedience to the orders
of Congress, everything in my power shall be done to
cultivate that disposition; but I trust it will be remembered,
that the best friends may be over burthened; that
by too frequent, too large, and too importunate demands
upon it, the most cordial friendship may be wearied, and
as nothing is more teazing than repeated, unexpected
large demands for money, I hope the Congress will absolutely
put an end to the practice of drawing on their
Ministers, and thereby obliging them to worry their respective
Courts for the means of payment. It may have
otherwise very ill effects in depressing the spirit of a
Minister, and destroying that freedom of representation,
which, on many occasions, it might be proper for him
to make use of.</p>

<p>I heartily congratulate you, Sir, on your being called
to the honorable and important office of President, and
wish you every kind of prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>Be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the Congress,
and believe me to be, with great and sincere
esteem and respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, November 24th, 1781.</p>
<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Major General du Portail will have the honor to present
this. Congress, in consideration of their long and faithful
services in this country, have granted permission to him
and Colonels de Laumoy and de Gourion, to revisit their
friends in Europe for the winter.</p>

<p>As the merit of these gentlemen has procured for them
particular marks of the esteem of Congress, they wish
them to be distinguished by the notice of their sovereign,
and for that purpose have directed that they be recommended
to you, and that you be requested to present them
at Court, in such a manner as will bespeak for them the
attention they justly merit.</p>

<p>Congress are persuaded that this task will be particularly
agreeable to you, as they are indebted to your care
for the useful services of these gentlemen, and as nothing
is more acceptable to a man of real merit, than to be made
the means of displaying it in others.</p>

<p>This is the third letter I have had the honor to write to
you since my entering upon office, and you will find it
numbered in the margin accordingly. I beg you will be
pleased to number all your letters to me in the same manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that I may know those which by any means may be
prevented from coming to hand.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, November 26th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, who has obtained leave to
revisit his family for the winter, does me the honor to be
the bearer of this, and duplicates of two former letters to
you. The degree of estimation in which he is held here,
you will collect from the enclosed resolutions relative to
him, so that you may converse freely with him, and I
doubt not that he will be able to satisfy your inquiries on
many important questions relative to this country, on which
account I may confine myself more to general heads than
I would otherwise do.</p>

<p>As to intelligence, there is little of importance, the army
all having gone into winter quarters, after the late glorious
campaign, the enemy having been defeated on every hand.
A party of about six hundred of them, who fell upon the
western frontier of New York, were the last that quitted
the stage; having been driven off by an inferior number
of militia, with the loss of their leaders, and many privates
killed, and about fifty, including the wounded, made prisoners.
A body of troops is detached to the southward to
reinforce General Greene, with orders to attempt Wilmington
on their way, which the enemy occupy with about five
hundred men, and keep up a connexion with the disaffected
counties in North Carolina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>We have not in a long time heard either from you or
Mr Jay, so that we are much in the dark respecting the
probable prospect of a negotiation this winter, or rather are
led to conclude from your silence, that the prospect is extremely
remote; in which case, all your objects will concentre
in preparing for the ensuing campaign, and directing
the operations as far as possible to this country. The
success of the combined operations this summer will give
great weight to your arguments, especially as they are such
as would deserve, independent of that, the most serious
attention. But, Sir, you will have a difficult card to play,
to induce France to do what not only our but her interests
essentially require. Never was there a time in which
money was more necessary to us than at present. The
total abolition of paper, the length of the war, the restricted
commerce we have carried on for the first five years of it,
the arrears of debts, and the slender thread by which public
credit hangs, put it totally out of our power to make any
great exertions without the immediate supply of money.
Taxation will be carried as far as it can go, but this will
fall very far short of our wants. The richest nations in Europe,
unable to carry on a war by taxation only, are compelled
to borrow. How then will it be expected that a
nation, which has had every difficulty to struggle with, an
enemy in the heart of its country, and all its considerable
towns at one time or another in their possession, a superior
navy on its coasts, and the consequential ruin of its agriculture
and commerce, how, I say, can it be expected that
such a nation should find resources within itself for so long
and bloody a war? And yet in this situation, we are
alarmed by our advices from you, by representations from
the Minister of France, by assurances from every quarter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that we must expect no further assistance in money.
Surely it is not possible that France, after having done so
much for us, after having brought us within view of the
desired haven, should oblige us to lose the advantage of all
she has done; and yet be assured that the most serious
consequence may attend her stopping her hand at this critical
time. Public credit, which is growing very fast, will
drop to the ground. The contracts made for the ensuing
campaign must be given up; the troops, who were made to
expect pay in specie, will be dissatisfied; and upon the
least ill fortune, a failure in supplies will show their discontents;
recruiting will be checked, and the conclusion of the
war on those advantageous terms, which one vigorous exertion
next spring in this country would secure, will be postponed
to a later period, when in fact all we wish, to enable
us to accomplish these great objects, is less than one year's
continuance of the war will cost France. You will, therefore,
show the necessity of setting our credit upon a firm
basis, the prospect we have of accomplishing it, from the
great confidence in the integrity and abilities of the financier,
from the economy which is introduced into our departments,
from the industry which money excites, and
which a fluctuating medium had destroyed, and from the
total debility which much attend another shock to public
credit.</p>

<p>You are perfectly acquainted, Sir, with the natural resources
of the country, you know the value of our exports,
and the security they afford for any debt that we may contract;
in short, there are a thousand arguments on this subject,
which will suggest themselves to you, not one of
which will you, upon this occasion, omit to urge, since you
must be perfectly convinced of its importance in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
view, both to France and to us. The Superintendent will
write more fully upon this subject, which relates so particularly
to his department.</p>

<p>I would beg leave to remind you of another want, which
we depend on your representations, and the good dispositions
of the Court of Versailles, to remove. The chase
here seems to be pretty well over, the enemy, tired of running
across the country, have taken to their burrows, and
the whole business that remains to us, is to take measures
for unearthing them next spring. In order to this, ships are
absolutely necessary. The situation of New York and
Charleston renders them untenable against a naval force,
and extremely strong against an attack by land; besides
that success in such an operation would not be decisive,
since, after putting us to immense expense of men and
ammunition of every kind, while they keep the command
of the water, they might change their position and be as
troublesome as ever. At any rate, the reduction of both
these places, from their distance, and the difficulty of removing
the men and stores, cannot be effected the same
campaign without a naval force, and with it, it will be the
business of a few weeks. The advantage to France, independent
of her interests as they stand connected with ours,
in keeping a great naval force on this continent is obvious.</p>

<p><em>1st.</em> The expense to which they put the English, by
obliging them to maintain an equal force at this distance
from home, at four times the cost at which the French
navy may be maintained in this country; which, with proper
management, need not exceed what they expend even in France.</p>

<p><em>2dly.</em> The number of seamen they employ in the
transport service, being so many deducted from what might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
supply their navy, with the same expense as if so employed.</p>

<p><em>3dly.</em> The protection afforded to the trade on this
coast, and the prospect of capturing the enemy's victuallers,
and the consequent ruin of their affairs.</p>

<p><em>4thly.</em> But above all, the decided advantage it will
afford our combined operations, and the speedy termination
of the war, by an advantageous peace. It is true, France
may have other objects, which may interfere with these.
To this we can say nothing; she must judge for herself.
All we can do is to point out what we conceive will be
most useful to her as well as to us, and submit to her
determination. It would be well, however, if we were
apprized of it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If a negotiation should open this winter, or there should
be a probable prospect of it, you will do me the favor to
give me the earliest advices of it. There are many delicate
points, on which you would like to know the sentiments of
people on this side of the water, which I will endeavor to
acquaint you with.</p>

<p>I should inform you, that Congress, have discharged the
commission for negotiating a treaty of commerce with
Great Britain, and taken that burthen from Mr Adams's
shoulders; that in compliment to the Marquis de Lafayette,
they have made him the bearer of a letter to the King
of France, which I enclose; that in answer to your favor
of the 11th of June, they have passed the enclosed resolution.</p>

<p>Mr Morris will write to you on this subject, and enable
you to discharge the bills. Should France send a fleet
next spring, it would be advantageous to have it unincumbered
with such orders, as may prevent its taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
advantage of circumstances. This has unhappily prevented
this campaign from being absolutely decisive. But
neither this, nor any other great object can escape your
observation, bent as it is upon promoting the happiness of
your country.</p>

<p>In order to enable you to meet the claim of the tories
to the property that has been confiscated, I am endeavoring
to collect for you an accurate account of the damages
wantonly done by the enemy in this country, which will at
least serve to set against that claim.</p>

<p>Congress are preparing for an active campaign. They
have directed eight millions of dollars to be raised by tax.
There is not, however, the least idea that this, or even one
half of it, will be collected in the time specified; you will
not, therefore, suffer the Court to deceive themselves, by
hopes of exertions founded on this measure, but urge again
and again the absolute necessity of supplying money.</p>

<p>I have conversed so freely with the Marquis de Lafayette
on the general state of our politics, that I would rather
refer you to him, than trouble you with a longer letter on
the subject.</p>

<p>I cannot however close this, without desiring you to
inquire whether any intercepted letters from Mr Deane to
persons in this country have been published in Europe.
Rivington has given us many, which are generally believed
to be his.</p>

<p>The Marquis will satisfy your inquiries about them.</p>

<p>I am, dear Sir, with sentiments of the highest respect
and esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM ALEXANDER TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, December 15th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I told you the last time I had the pleasure of seeing
you at Passy, that I would make a trip to London, but had
no notion it would be so soon. On coming to town last
evening, I found such pressing letters, that I propose setting
off this evening, or tomorrow at latest. I would have
called, if possible, to receive your commands, but as I am
pinched in time, I must content myself with sending for
them. The bearer will call for them an hour after receiving
this letter.</p>

<p>I shall probably be interrogated about the dispositions in
this country to peace. My own idea is, that you seek
only your independence, and that <em>this</em> country, were that
secured, will be moderate in other matters, as the object
of the war does not seem to be conquest. Let me know
if this is proper language. I notice that a courtly argument
has been used in Parliament for continuing the continental
war, that withdrawing would make you insolent,
and give France exclusive advantages. Were it not
proper that this were contradicted flatly? Any commissions
you may have will be taken care of, and I shall be back,
barring accidents, in three weeks.</p>

<p>Wishing you everything that is good, I remain, with
equal esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient
humble servant.</p>

<p>I received your favor of September 26th, containing
your very judicious proposition of securing the spectators

even the lives of your enemies, does honor to your heart

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, December 16th, 1781.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Since my last, of which I send you a duplicate by this
conveyance, nothing material has happened here, unless it
be the evacuation of Wilmington, which is, perhaps, the
most important post of communication with the disaffected
people of the country of any they have held in America.
The tories of North Carolina possessed a boldness and
spirit, which were not found elsewhere, and upon occasion
appeared openly in arms. They are by these means abandoned
to the enemy, and the resentment of their country.</p>

<p>The cypher, which I shall use with you, is No. 4 of
those sent by Mr Morris; in that, the duplicate is written
which went uncyphered by the Marquis de Lafayette.</p>

<p>I enclose a resolution of Congress for erecting a pillar
to commemorate the victory at Yorktown. I must request
your assistance in enabling me to carry it into effect,
so far as it relates to me, by sending the sketch they
require, with an estimate of the expense with which it will
be attended. I could wish it to be such, as may do honor
to the nations, whose union it designs to celebrate, and for
that reason should think the execution ought to be deferred
till our finances are in a better situation than they
are at present; but as this lies with Congress only, you
will be so obliging as to enable me to do my duty, by laying
the sketch before them as soon as you can conveniently
get the same executed.</p>

<p>I have also the honor to enclose an ordinance of Congress,
which comprises all their former resolutions with
respect to captures, with the addition of some others;
among them, one for "prohibiting the importation of British
goods," unless such as may have been taken from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
enemy. This will make some arrangements with the Court
of France necessary. The high duties upon prize goods
consumed in France render them considerable articles of
exportation, and unless some mode is fallen upon to evidence
their having been captured, they will be liable to
seizure here. I would propose that the Lieutenants of the
Admiralty, or some other officers in the seaport towns,
should, to an inventory of the goods shipped, annex a certificate
under hand and seal, of their having been captured
from the enemy, and that this should be done without any
charge to the purchaser. You, Sir, who are better acquainted
with the interior of the government of France,
than I can be supposed to be, will be pleased to suggest

presents itself, to use means for carrying what I propose
into effect. I send by this conveyance a number of

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, January 2d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I have received the favor of yours of the 15th of December
by Mr Alexander. I most heartily join with you in
the wish, that we could find some means to stop the
spreading flames of this <em>devilish war</em>. I will not despair.
The communications, which he has imparted to me from
you, have revived my hopes of peace. I laid them before
the Minister immediately. We are at a suspense for
the present upon a very material preliminary. I did intend
writing to you at the present pause, that we might
make our ground good as we go on, but an accident which
has happened obliges me to do it without delay. For
having had a most essential question transmitted to me
from Lord North for explanation, when I would have applied
to Mr Alexander, I could not find him; and now I
find that he has left his hotel these four or five days, and
his return being uncertain, I must apply to you. I will
state to you what has passed.</p>

<p>Upon my first interview with Mr Alexander, he told me,
that the late events would make no difference in the prospect
of peace; that America had no other wish than to
see a termination of this war; that no events would make
them unreasonable on that subject, which sentiments likewise
your letter expresses; and that no formal recognition
of independence would be required. I thought this a very
fair opening; but the next point, which he explained to me,
seemed to be still more material towards peace, viz. that
America was disposed to enter into a separate treaty with
Great Britain, and their allies were disposed to consent to
it. I believe that it has been the unfortunate union of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
common cause between America and France, which has
for the last three years turned aside the wish of the people
of England for peace. I verily believe (so deep is the
jealousy between England and France,) that this country
would fight for a straw to the last man, and the last shilling,
rather than be dictated to by France. I therefore consider
this as the greatest rub out of the way. I have often
argued this point with you upon former occasions, having
at all times foreseen, that it would be the greatest rub in
the road to peace, and I have often stated it to you as
an act of <em>justice</em> due to America from her allies, not to
drag her through a war of European resentments and
jealousies, beyond her original views and engagements;
and moreover, I think the separation of the causes in the
negotiation promises much the shortest road to a general
peace.</p>

<p>Upon Mr Alexander's opening thus much to me, I told
him I would apply for the earliest opportunity of laying
these matters before the Minister. Accordingly on Friday
morning, December the 21st, I applied through the means
of the Earl of Guilford, father to Lord North, a nobleman
of a most respectable character, advanced in years,
and attached by every possible tie to a son now in the most
arduous situation, I therefore requested the favor through
his hands, as giving me the most conciliatory access to the
Minister, to whom I was preparing to make an application
for peace. After the appointment was made with Lord
North for Friday evening, I returned to Mr Alexander, to
consider the specific manner and terms in which I should
make my application. It had occurred to me, from what
Mr Alexander had stated to me, that the Conciliatory Bill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
which I had moved in the last Parliament, on June the
27th, 1780, would still serve as a foundation to proceed
upon; I therefore carried it with me.</p>

<p>He told me, that he and you knew the sense of the bill
very well, and that it would be entirely consonant to your
sentiments, that I should state it to Lord North, as drawing
an outline for a negotiation of peace. However, to avoid all
errors, I read the bill through to him, and explained the
view of each clause, viz. the style of <em>Provinces of North
America</em>, a general phrase, to avoid any term denoting
dependence or independence; the truce for an indefinite
term; the articles of intercourse for ten years certain; to
restore an amicable correspondence, and to abate animosities;
the suspension of certain acts of Parliament; to
avoid every possible question of dependence or independence;
and to finish the work, by a ratification of each
article of intercourse as agreed to, thereby to prevent all
possible return of war. I compared the articles of intercourse
for a short term, and their ratification into a permanent
peace, to a well known mode of proceeding in the
laws of England, by lease and release, from temporary to
perpetual amity and peace.</p>

<p>Upon these grounds I took my commission from him for
Lord North, viz. the question of dependence or independence
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub silentio</i>, a separate treaty with America, and to
state the Conciliatory Bill of June, 1780, as, the outline of
negotiation. I saw Lord North in the evening, and stated
the foregoing propositions to him, as I have now stated
them to you. After having stated the compromise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub
silentio</i> and the separate treaty, I left with Lord North the
copy of the bill of June, 1780, together with a paper, entitled,
<cite>Conciliatory Propositions</cite>, as explanatory of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
bill, both enclosed with this. The next morning, viz.
Saturday, December the 22d, I saw Mr Alexander, and
reported to him what I had stated to Lord North, and
showed him a copy of the paper, entitled <cite>Conciliatory
Propositions</cite>. He told me, that I had executed my commission
perfectly to his intelligence of the matter. I
should tell you, that at the conclusion of my conversation
with Lord North, we both settled jointly the result thus;
"I recommend to your Lordship the propositions which I
have had the honor of stating to you, as <em>general grounds
of a proposed negotiation, leading towards peace, under
liberal constructions</em>." Lord North said in answer, "so I
understand them."</p>

<p>Upon this footing, matters rested for some days. On
Sunday last, December the 30th, I received a message
from Lord North, through the means of Lord Guilford,
requesting an explanation of this point, viz. "Who is authorised
to treat on the part of America? whether you or
Mr Adams, or both jointly; and whether the propositions
above stated would be acknowledged, as general grounds
of negotiation towards peace, by the person or persons
authorised to treat; because it was necessary, before he
could lay a matter of so great importance before the Cabinet
Council, that he should be entitled to say, these
propositions and general outlines come to me from responsible
and authorised persons." The moment I received
the request of Lord North, I agreed entirely with the necessity
of an explanation on that head. I had partly expected
such an inquiry, and it gave me satisfaction when
it came, as I thought it the first reply towards a parley.
If the propositions had not gained some attention, it would
have been of very little importance to have inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
whence they came. As to the caution itself, it appears to
me not only prudent but indispensable. The forms of
caution in such cases are the essentials of caution. I had
determined on my own account before this message to
have written to you, that I might have received your sentiments
directly from yourself without any other intervention,
that we might proceed with caution and certainty in a
matter of such infinite importance. This message has
only quickened my despatch. The two points of explanation
requested, I take to be these; whether the outlines
above recited are properly stated, always considering that
they imply no further than <em>general grounds of negotiation
towards peace, under liberal constructions</em>; and secondly,
by what authorised person or persons any answer on this
subject would be accepted; in short, a requisition of credentials
preparatory to a formal answer, which is so much
the more necessary on the supposition of a favorable reception
of the first hint towards negotiation.</p>

<p>When I last saw Mr Alexander, viz. about four or five
days ago, he had met with some desponding impressions,
as if the Ministry were indisposed to peace, and that
things would not do, &amp;c. He did not tell me upon what
ground he had formed such apprehension; however, lest
he should have imparted any such by letter to you, I will
state that point to you, because it may have infinite ill consequences
to be too touchy on such occasions. A premature
jealousy may create the very evil it suspects. The
Ministry in this country are not everything. The sense of
the people, when really expressed and exerted, would be
most prevalent. Suppose then it were a proved point,
that every man in the Ministry were in his heart adverse
to peace. What then? withhold all overtures! By no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
means. I should advise the very contrary in the strongest
manner. I should say, let the overtures be made so
much the more public and explicit by those who do wish
for peace. It is the unfortunate state of things, which has
hitherto bound the cause of France to any possible treaty
with America, and which has thereby thrown a national
damp upon any actual public exertions to procure a negotiation
for peace with America. I have the strongest
opinion, that if it were publicly known to the people of
England, that a negotiation might be opened with America,
upon the terms above specified, that all the Ministry together,
if they were ill disposed to a man, would not venture
to thwart such a measure.</p>

<p>But why should it be supposed, that the Ministry, to
a man, are ill disposed to a peace? Suppose them to be
half and half, and the public wish and voice of the people
in favor of negotiation, it is evident on which side the balance
would incline. But why should we seek to throw a
damp prematurely upon any chance? Why presume even
against any individual? I grant, that it would be a bitter
trial of humility to be brought to a formal recognition of
independence at the haughty command of France, and I
believe every part of the nation would proceed to every
extremity before they would submit to that. But if that
touchy point can be provided for, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub silentio</i>, and if the
proposed treaty with America may be carried on free
from control by France, let us give the cause of peace a
fair trial; at the worst we should but be where we were
if we should fail. But why should we expect to fail,
when the greatest rub is removed, by the liberty of entering
separately into a treaty? I think it a most favorable
event, leading towards peace. Give us a truce with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
concomitants, and a little time so given for cooling will
have most excellent effects on both sides. Eternal peace
and conciliation may then follow.</p>

<p>I send this to you by the quickest despatch, that we
may bring this point to a fair issue before the meeting of
Parliament. God prosper the blessed work of peace.</p>

<p>I am ever yours most affectionately,</p>

<p class="signature">
D. HARTLEY.
</p>

<p><em>P. S. Jauary 8th, 1782.</em> Since writing this letter,
I have seen Mr Alexander, and shall see him from time to
time to communicate with him. I do not suppose I shall
have an answer from Lord North till the preliminary points
are so settled, as to enable him to give an answer in form.
The Ministry might undoubtedly give a short negative, if
they thought proper; but I do not expect that. You may
be assured, that I have and shall continue to enforce every
argument in the most conciliatory manner to induce a negotiation.
I am very sorry for Mr A.'s confinement, on his
own account, and on that of his friends, and because probably
in the future state of this business his personal exertions
may be very serviceable in the cause of peace.
Every assistance and every exertion of mine will always
be most heartily devoted to that cause. I have nothing
further to add, either upon my own reflections or from my
subsequent conversations with Mr Alexander, to what I
have stated in the foregoing letter. If we once make a
good beginning upon the plan there stated, I should hope
that such a negotiation, founded on such principles, would
promise fair to produce every salutary and pacific concequence
in the event.</p>

<h3>REMARKS ON THE CONCILIATORY BILL</h3>

<p><em>In the title and preamble</em> of the bill, the words <em>Provinces
of North America</em> are used as general words, neither implying
dependence or independence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clause I.</span> <em>The Truce</em> is taken from the Conciliatory
Act of 1778, and is indefinite as to the proposed duration
of the truce. Under this clause it might be proposed to
negotiate three points, viz. the removal of the British
troops from the Thirteen Provinces of North America, and
connectedly with this article, a stipulation for the security
of the friends of the British government. The third article
might be a stipulation, that the respective parties, during
the continuance of the truce, should not either directly
or indirectly give assistance to the enemies of each
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clause II.</span> <em>Articles of Intercourse and Pacification.</em>
Under this clause some arrangements might be settled, for
establishing a free and mutual intercourse, civil and commercial,
between Great Britain and the aforesaid Provinces
of North America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clause III.</span> <em>Suspension of certain Acts of Parliament.</em>
By this clause a free communication may be kept
open between the two countries, during the negotiation for
peace, without stumbling against any claim of rights, which
might draw into contest the question of dependence or
independence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clause IV.</span> <em>The Ratification by Parliament.</em> The
object of this clause is to consolidate peace and conciliation,
step by step, as the negotiation may proceed; and to
prevent, as far as possible, any return of war, after the
first declaration of a truce. By the operation of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
clause, a temporary truce may be converted into a perpetual
and permanent peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clause V.</span> <em>A Temporary Act.</em> This clause, creating
a temporary act for a specific purpose of negotiation in
view, is taken from the act of 1778.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, January 7th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>As it does not appear improbable, that the humiliation
and misfortunes of Great Britain may produce the same
sentiments, which a spirit of moderation dictates to the
other belligerent powers, and lead her to concur with
them in their wishes for peace, it cannot be improper
to acquaint you with the objects America most wishes to
attain, and to furnish you with the arguments on which
they found their claim to them. For such is the confidence,
not only in the justice of His Most Christian
Majesty, but in his friendship, that they firmly persuade
themselves, that he will not only preserve for them their
undoubted rights, but that he will even go so far as to
procure for them those advantages they may reasonably
demand, on the close of a successful war; and I am
perfectly satisfied, that the loose hints that a detail of
their sentiments may afford you, and our other Commissioners,
will be strengthened and improved by your lights
in such manner, as to come before his Majesty in the
most advantageous form.</p>

<p>The first point of discussion will be the limits of the
United States. The instructions given Mr Adams on the
&mdash;&mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash; last, explain the wishes of Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
on that subject, nor can they admit of many doubts,
except so far as they relate to our southern extent.
The boundary between us and Canada being very well
ascertained by grants, charters, proclamations, and other
acts of government, and more particularly by the settlements
of people, who are engaged in the same cause with
us, and who have the same rights with the rest of the subjects
of the United States.</p>

<p>Our western and northwestern extent will probably be
contested with some warmth, and the reasoning on that
subject be deduced from general principles, and from
proclamations and treaties with the Indians.</p>

<p>The subject is undoubtedly intricate and delicate, yet,
upon candid investigation, I believe it will appear, that our
extension to the Mississippi is founded in justice; and that
our claims are at least such as the events of the war give
us a right to insist upon. Your situation, furnishing you
amply with the various documents on which Great Britain
founded her claim to all the country east of the Mississippi
previous to the treaty of Paris, I will not trouble you with
references to them, which would at any rate be imperfect,
from the want which prevails here of books and papers.
Taking it for granted, that the King of Great Britain was
entitled to that extent of country, (which he at least cannot
contravene) it only remains to examine how far he considers
it as within the limits of some of the United States,
because he can no more pretend to abridge those limits,
than claim any other right of which the United States
are in possession.</p>

<p>His idea of these limits is apparent from charters
granted by the crown, and from recent grants made by its
representatives in several of the States, it appears that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
considered their authority to grant lands to the westward,
as coextensive with the right of Great Britain, unless they
were restricted by their interference with other governments.
Upon this principle, the servants of the crown in
New York granted land on the borders of Lake Erie, to
the westward of Niagara. And Virginia, even after the
proclamation in 1763, patented considerable tracts upon
the Ohio, far beyond the Appalachian mountains. It is
true, the several governments were prohibited at different
times from granting lands beyond certain limits, but these
were clearly temporary restrictions, which the policy of
maintaining a good understanding with the natives dictated,
and were always broken through after a short period, as is
evinced by the grants abovementioned, made subsequent
to the proclamation in 1763. And indeed the proclamation
itself furnishes a substantial argument of the opinion
of Britain, with respect to the right which some
of the States had to extend to the westward of the limits
it prescribed, otherwise it would not have been necessary
to prohibit their governors from granting, as their
patents would, in such cases, have been invalid, and themselves
subjected to the censure of their master upon whom
they were dependent. Unless, therefore, these proclamations
absolutely destroyed the right, they must be considered
as proofs of its existence at least, and after they were
issued. The slightest examination of them shows, that
they did not take away, but restrained an existing right,
and the subsequent grants by the governors evidence
that they were, as is before asserted, mere temporary
restrictions. The same reasoning applies to the treaty at
Fort Stanwix, and to other agreements taken from treaties
with the Indians. Strong evidence in our favor is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
found in the map made by the King's geographer, in which
Virginia and the Carolinas are laid down as extending to
the Mississippi, shortly after the last war. Arguments may
be drawn against us by the Quebec Bill, but as this is one
of the laws that occasioned the war, to build anything
upon it would be to urge one wrong in support of another.
But this matter may perhaps be seen in a different light,
and our pretensions placed upon a more extensive basis
by recurring to general principles, and asking whence
Great Britain derived her right to the waste lands in
America.</p>

<p>Evidently, from the allegiance which a subject is supposed
to carry with him wherever he goes, even though he
dislikes his constitution and seeks one that pleases him
better, upon this false principle, the oppressed subjects
of Great Britain, seeking freedom in the wilds of America,
were supposed to extend to it the sovereignty of the kingdom
they had left. The rights of the King of Great
Britain then to America were incident to his right of sovereignty
over those of his subjects that settled America,
and explored the lands he claims. For the idea of right
derived from mere discovery, and the vain ceremony of
taking possession without planting and continuing that possession,
is now fully exploded. If then we admit what is
necessary to our independence, that the right of sovereignty
over the people of America is forfeited, it must follow,
that all rights founded in that sovereignty are forfeited with
it; and that upon our setting up a new sovereign in
America, the rights which the first claimed as such, devolve
upon the second. Upon this principle, Great Britain
is left without a foot of land in America beyond the limits
of those governments which acknowledge her jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>It is in vain to say, that the King of Great Britain
holds these back lands by a cession from other powers.
Since those cessions were grounded upon a prior claim,
derived through the people of America, and only served to
confirm the right which they gave the King of Great
Britain while he was their sovereign, and which he loses
with his sovereignty over them. This mode of reasoning
is warranted by the practice Great Britain uniformly held
of treating with the Indian nations through their American
governors, who have frequently executed with them the
most solemn acts, and sometimes extended the King's
protection to the nations who occupy the waste lands,
which are the subject of our present claim. The
expense of retaining these in friendship, almost always
devolved upon the respective States, who, till lately, particularly
in New York, voted the sums necessary to support
smiths among them, and to procure the presents
which were annually made them. From hence, then, it
follows, that if the King of Great Britain has any right
over the back lands in America, it must be as King of
the people of America; ceasing to be King of those people,
his right also ceases. If he has no right over the
back lands, but merely as protector of the savage nations
that inhabit them, that connexion and duty also devolve
upon us, since they evidently claimed that protection from
him as King of the Colonies, and through the governors
of those Colonies, and not as sovereign of a country three
thousand miles from them. This country having chosen a
new sovereign, they may rightfully claim its protection.</p>

<p>There is some reason to believe, that Great Britain considered
their rights in many instances as extending no
further than their right of preemption and protection, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
may be inferred from passages in the negotiations for a
peace with France in the year 1761, referred to in the
margin. This suggests a new idea, which, however, I am
not warranted by any act of Congress in mentioning, and
therefore you will only consider it as the sentiment of an
individual. If the mediators should not incline to admit
our claim, but determine on restricting our limits, either by
the extent of our grants, the course of the mountains, the
sources of the rivers, or any other of those arbitrary rules
that must be sought for when solid principles are relinquished,
perhaps it would not be difficult to bring them to
agree, that the country beyond those limits belongs to the
nations which inhabit it; that it should enjoy its independence
under the guarantee of France, Spain, Great
Britain, and America, and be open to the trade of those
whose lands border upon them.</p>

<p>This, though restrictive of our rights, would free us from
the well grounded apprehensions, that the vicinity of Great
Britain and her command of the savages would give us.
They already possess Canada and Nova Scotia; should
that immense territory, which lies upon the rear of the
States, from the Gulf of St Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico,
be acknowledged to be vested in Great Britain, it will
render our situation truly hazardous. The lands, as you
know, are infinitely better than those on the coast; they
have an open communication with the sea by the rivers St
Lawrence and the Mississippi, and with each other by
those extensive inland seas with which America abounds.
They will be settled with the utmost rapidity from Europe,
but more particularly from these States. Attachment to
the government, freedom from taxes, a prospect of bettering
their fortunes, and the fertility of the soil, will invite numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to leave us. This, co-operating with the leaven of dissatisfaction,
which will continue to work here for many
years, may produce the most dangerous effects, especially
upon the Southern States, which will, from the nature of
their soil and husbandry, be thinly settled for many years,
while the lands, which lie near them beyond the mountains,
will soon be filled with a hardy race of people inimical
to them, who to their own strength will be enabled to
join that of the savages, subject to their command.</p>

<p>If it is an object with the maritime powers to lessen the
power, and by that means diminish the dangerous dominion
that Great Britain has in some measure usurped over
the ocean, they must prevent her possessing herself of the
country in question, since, besides the whole fur and peltry
trade, that she will thereby engross, the demands of
this great country will give a new spring to her manufactures,
which, though the Floridas should be ceded to Spain,
will find their way into it by the river St Lawrence, and
through the numerous lakes and rivers which communicate
with it. Add to this, that settlements are already formed
beyond the Appalachian mountains by people who acknowledge
the United States, which not only give force to our
claims, but render a relinquishment of their interest highly
impolitic and unjust. These, and a variety of other reasons,
which will suggest themselves to you and the gentlemen
joined in the commission with you, will doubtless be
urged in such terms as to convince the Court of France,
that our mutual interests conspire to keep Great Britain
from any territory on this continent beyond the bounds of
Canada. Should the Floridas be ceded to Spain, she will
certainly unite with you on this point, as the security of
that cession will depend upon its success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>The <em>Fisheries</em> will probably be another source of litigation,
not because our rights are doubtful, but because Great
Britain has never paid much attention to rights, which interfere
with her views.</p>

<p>The arguments on which the people of America found
their claim to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland arise,
first, from their having once formed a part of the British
empire, in which state they always enjoyed, as fully as
the people of Britain themselves, the right of fishing on
those Banks. They have shared in all the wars for the
extension of that right, and Britain could with no more justice
have excluded them from the enjoyment of it, (even
supposing that one nation could possess it to the exclusion
of another,) while they formed a part of that empire, than
they could exclude the people of London or Bristol. If
so, the only inquiry is, how have we lost this right. If we
were tenants in common with Great Britain, while united
with her, we still continue so, unless by our own act we
have relinquished our title. Had we parted with mutual
consent, we should doubtless have made partition of our
common rights by treaty. But the oppressions of Great
Britain forced us to a separation, (which must be admitted,
or we have no right to be independent) and it cannot certainly
be contended that those oppressions abridged our
rights, or gave new ones to Britain. Our rights then are
not invalidated by this separation, more particularly as we
have kept up our claim from the commencement of the
war, and assigned the attempt of Great Britain to exclude
us from the fisheries as one of the causes of our recurring
to arms.</p>

<p>The second ground upon which we place our right to
fish on the Banks of Newfoundland, provided we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
come within such distance of the coasts of other powers, as
the law of nations allows them to appropriate, is the right
which nature gives to all mankind to use its common benefit,
so far as not to exclude others. The sea cannot in its
nature be appropriated; no nation can put its mark upon
it. Though attempts have sometimes been made to set
up an empire over it, they have been considered as unjust
usurpations, and resisted as such, in turn, by every maritime
nation in Europe. The idea of such empire is now
fully exploded by the best writers.</p>

<p>The whale fishery in every sea, and even upon the
coasts of princes, who do not exercise it themselves, is considered
as a common right, and is enjoyed by those nations
that choose to pursue it. The cod fishery, upon the Dogger
Bank, and other parts of the European seas, is claimed
exclusively by no nation. The herring fishery is carried
on daily by the Dutch on the coast of England, and if the
Banks of Newfoundland are not equally common, it is because
some nations have relinquished their rights, and
others find it impossible to exercise them, for want of harbors
to receive their vessels, or shores to dry their fish on.</p>

<p>When we say we are willing to exercise it under these
inconveniences, there can certainly be no further dispute
about our right, and the only remaining questions will be
the distance that we ought to keep from the shores possessed
by the enemy; though, strictly speaking, from our first principle,
we have a common right in them.</p>

<p>This subject is treated so much at large by Grotius and
Vattel, that I do not think it necessary to detail arguments,
which, though urged by people here from their feelings,
you will find much better stated there. Give me leave
however to urge some, that may arise from our particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
circumstances. All the New England States are much
interested in this point; the State of Massachusetts more
particularly; it has no staple; it does not raise its own
bread; its principal commerce consisted before the war
in fish, which it supplied to the rest of the continent in
exchange for rice, flour, &amp;c., and to the West Indies for
rum, sugar, and molasses. It shipped little to Europe;
first, because it could not fish so cheap as the people of
England; secondly, because their fish was not so well
cured in general, owing to their fishing at improper seasons,
and to their using salt which is said to be of a more harsh
nature, than what the European vessels bring out with
them. Should this State and New Hampshire, which is
almost in similar circumstances, be excluded from the fisheries,
they must be reduced to great distress. It will be
impossible for them to pay for the necessaries they must
receive from abroad. They will see with pain their sister
States in the full enjoyment of the benefits, which will result
from their independence, while their own commerce is
checked, and their State impoverished. They will consider
their interests as sacrificed to the happiness of others,
and can hardly forbear to foster that discontent, which may
be productive of disunion, and the most dangerous divisions.</p>

<p>An idea has also gone forth, and it is fomented by the
disaffected, that France wishes, from interested views, to
monopolise the fisheries; or, at least to exclude all other
competitors but Great Britain. Those, who have attended
to the disinterested conduct of France during the war, oppose
to this sentiment the honor and good faith of their
ally, the little interest that he can have in excluding a
people from a right, which would not interfere with his,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
since France does little more than supply herself; and the
New England fishery, for the most part, only supplies the
continent and islands of America. They see the care with
which France has endeavored to cultivate a good understanding
between that Kingdom and these States, and
they are persuaded so inconsiderable an object will not be
put in competition with the harmony, which ought to subsist
between them, or administer food to those unworthy
jealousies. And so much does this sentiment prevail in
Congress, that their prospects have not induced them to
alter your instructions; more particularly as they have received
through the Minister of France assurances, that his
Majesty was pleased with the proof Congress had given
him of their confidence, and that he would in no event
make any sacrifices of their essential interests, which necessity
should not compel him to do; that he had no
reason to apprehend from the events of the war, that such
necessity would exist. These events have become so
much more favorable since the date of the letter, which
contained these assurances, that Congress persuade themselves
his Majesty will not be driven to make sacrifices
equally painful to him and injurious to us; but that, as we
owe our success in war to his magnanimity and generosity,
we may be equally indebted to his justice and firmness for
an honorable peace.</p>

<p>It is not improbable, that Great Britain will endeavor to
make some stipulations in favor of their American partisans,
who have been banished the country, or whose property
has been forfeited. You will doubtless be sensible of
the inconvenience and danger, to which their return will
subject us, and the injustice of restoring to them what they
have so justly forfeited; while no compensation is made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
us for the loss of property, and the calamities they have
occasioned.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, that every society may rightfully
banish from among them those, who aim at its subversion,
and forfeit the property, which they can only be
entitled to by the laws, and under the protection of the
society, which they attempt to destroy. Without troubling
you, therefore, on the point of right, I will just mention
a few of the consequences that would result from
a stipulation in their favor.</p>

<p>In the first place, it will excite general dissatisfaction
and tumults. They are considered here as the authors
of the war. Those who have lost relations and friends
by it, those who have been insulted by them while starving
in prisons and prison-ships, those who have been
robbed and plundered, or who have had their houses
burned and their families ill treated by them, will, in
despite of all law, or treaties, avenge themselves, if the
real or supposed authors of these calamities ever put
themselves in their power; nor will the government be
able to prevent what the feeling of the body of the people
will justify.</p>

<p>Should they be permitted to reside among us, they
will neglect no means to injure and subvert our constitution
and government, and to sow divisions among us in
order to pave the way for the introduction of the old
system. They will be dangerous partisans of the enemy,
equally unfriendly to France and to us, and will show
themselves such upon every occasion. To restore their
property in many instances is now become impossible.
It has been sold from hand to hand; the money arising
from it has been sunk by depreciation in the public treasury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
To raise the value by taxes, or to wrest the lands
from the hands of the proprietors, is equally unjust and
impossible. Many of the very people, who would demand
the restitution, have grown rich by the spoil and plunder
of this country. Many others, who were beggars at the
beginning of this war, owe their present affluence to the
same cause.</p>

<p>So that at least the account between the two nations
should be liquidated, before any claim can be set up by the
aggressors. How far it will be possible to obtain a compensation
for the injuries wantonly done by the enemy,
you will be best able to judge; be assured that it is
anxiously desired.</p>

<p>Give me leave to mention to you the necessity of stipulating
for the safe delivery of all records, and other papers
of a public and private nature, which the enemy have possessed
themselves of; particularly of the records of New
York, which Mr Tryon sent to England; and the private
papers of many gentlemen of the law in different
parts of the continent, by which the rights of individuals
may be materially affected.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, I have touched upon the principal points, that
America wishes to attain in the peace, which must end this
bloody war. Perhaps in so doing I have given both you
and myself unnecessary trouble, since I have urged nothing
but what your own knowledge of the country, and that of
the other gentlemen in the commission, would have suggested
to you. However, conceiving that circumstances
might render it necessary for you to declare, that you
spoke nothing more than the prevailing sentiments of your
Court, this letter will serve to vouch for the assertion.</p>

<p>Should the Floridas be ceded to Spain, as there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
nothing Congress have more at heart than to maintain that
friendly intercourse with them, which this revolution has
happily begun, it will be essential to fix their limits precisely,
for which purpose the instructions to Mr Adams
will serve as your directions.</p>

<p>Affairs here are in the same state that they were when
I last wrote, except that the enemy in South Carolina
have called in all their outposts, and shut themselves up in
Charleston, where they will be closely invested when General
St Clair joins, which must have happened about the
last of December. The brilliant expedition to St Eustatia
does the highest honor to the Marquis de Bouillé and
the French nation. I flatter myself that it will be of singular
use to Mr Adam's negotiations.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, January 15th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received a few days since your favor of the 2d instant,
in which you tell me, that Mr Alexander had informed
you, "America was disposed to enter into a separate treaty
with Great Britain." I am persuaded, that your strong
desire for peace has misled you, and occasioned your
greatly misunderstanding Mr Alexander; as I think it
scarce possible he should have asserted a thing <em>so utterly
void of foundation</em>. I remember that you have, as you
say, often urged this on former occasions, and that it always
gave me more disgust than my friendship for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
permitted me to express. But since you have now gone so
far as to carry such a proposition to Lord North, as arising
from us, it is necessary that I should be explicit with you,
and tell you plainly, that I never had such an idea, and I
believe there is not a man in America, a few <em>English
tories</em> excepted, that would not spurn at the thought of
deserting a noble and generous friend, for the sake of a
truce with an unjust and cruel enemy.</p>

<p>I have again read over your Conciliatory Bill, with the
manuscript propositions that accompany it, and am concerned
to find, that one cannot give vent to a simple wish
for peace, a mere sentiment of humanity, without having it
interpreted as <em>a disposition to submit to any base conditions</em>
that may be offered us, rather than continue the war; for,
on no other supposition could you propose to us a truce of
ten years, during which we are to engage not to assist
France, while you continue the war with her. A truce
too, wherein nothing is to be mentioned that may weaken
your pretensions to dominion over us, which you may
therefore resume at the end of the term, or at pleasure;
when we should have so covered ourselves with infamy,
by our treachery to our first friend, as that no other nation
can ever after be disposed to assist us, however cruelly
you might think fit to treat us. Believe me, my dear
friend, America has too much understanding, and is too
sensible of the value of the world's good opinion, to forfeit
it all by such perfidy. The Congress will never instruct
their Commissioners to obtain a peace on such ignominious
terms; and though there can be but few things in which
I should venture to disobey their orders, yet, if it were
possible for them to give me such an order as this, I should
certainly refuse to act; I should instantly renounce their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
commission, and banish myself forever from so infamous a
country.</p>

<p>We are a little ambitious too of your esteem; and as
I think we have acquired some share of it, by our manner
of making war with you, I trust we shall not hazard the
loss of it, by consenting meanly to a dishonorable peace.</p>

<p>Lord North was wise in demanding of you some authorised
acknowledgment of the proposition from authorised
persons. He justly thought it too improbable to be relied
on, so as to lay it before the Privy Council. You can
now inform him, that the whole has been a mistake, and
that no such proposition as that of a separate peace has
been, is, or is ever likely to be made by me; and I believe
by no other authorised person whatever in behalf of
America. You may further, if you please, inform his
Lordship, that Mr Adams, Mr Laurens, Mr Jay, and myself,
have long since been empowered, by a special commission,
to treat of peace whenever a negotiation shall be
opened for that purpose; but it must always be understood,
that this is to be in conjunction with our allies, conformably
to the solemn treaties made with them.</p>

<p>You have, my dear friend, a strong desire to promote
peace, and it is a most laudable and virtuous desire. Permit
me then to wish, that you would, in order to succeed
as a mediator, avoid such invidious expressions as may
have an effect in preventing your purpose. You tell me
that no stipulation for our independence must be in the
treaty, because you "verily believe, so deep is the jealousy
between England and France, that England would fight
for a straw, to the last man and the last shilling, rather
than be <em>dictated to</em> by France." And again, that, "the
nation would proceed to every extremity, rather than be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
brought to a formal recognition of independence at the
<em>haughty command</em> of France." My dear Sir, if every
proposition of terms for peace, that may be made by one
of the parties at war, is to be called and considered by the
other as <em>dictating</em>, and a <em>haughty command</em>, and for that
reason rejected, with a resolution of fighting to the last
man rather than agree to it, you see that in such case no
treaty of peace is possible.</p>

<p>In fact we began the war for independence on your government,
which we found tyrannical, and this before
France had anything to do with our affairs; the article in
our treaty whereby the "two parties engage, that neither
of them shall conclude either truce or peace with Great
Britain, without the formal consent of the other first obtained;
and mutually engage, not to lay down their arms
until the independence of the United States shall have
been formally or <em>tacitly</em> assured, by the treaty or treaties,
that shall terminate the war," was an article inserted at
our instance, being in our favor. And you see, by the article
itself, that your great difficulty may be easily got over,
as a formal acknowledgment of our independence is not
made necessary. But we hope by God's help to enjoy
it; and I suppose we shall fight for it as long as we are
able.</p>

<p>I do not make any remarks upon the other propositions,
because I think that unless they were made by authority,
the discussion of them is unnecessary and may be inconvenient.
The supposition of our being disposed to make a
separate peace I could not be silent upon, as it materially
affected our reputation and its essential interests. If I
have been a little warm on that offensive point, reflect on
your repeatedly urging it, and endeavor to excuse me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever may be the fate of our poor countries, let you
and me die as we have lived, in peace with each other.</p>

<p>Assuredly I continue, with great and sincere esteem, my
dear friend, yours most affectionately,</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, January 18th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter your Excellency did me the honor
of writing to me this day enclosing a Memorial,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which
relates to the interests of some subjects of the Emperor,
residing at Ostend, who allege that a ship of theirs has
been taken by an American privateer, and carried into
Boston, on pretence that the property was English, &amp;c. I
shall immediately transmit the Memorial to Congress, as
desired. But there being Courts of Admiralty established
in each of the United States, I conceive, that the regular
steps to be taken by the complainants would be an application
for justice to those Courts by some person on the
spot, duly authorised by them as their agents, and in case
the judgment of the Court is not satisfactory, that then
they appeal to the Congress, which cannot well take cognisance
of such matters in the first instance.</p>

<p>The merchants of Ostend may possibly not have as yet
correspondents established in all the States, but any merchant
of credit in the country would transact such business
on receiving their request, with the proper power of attorney;
or if His Imperial Majesty should think fit to appoint a
Consul General to reside in those States, such an officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
might at all times assist his compatriots with his counsels
and protection, in any affairs that they might have in that
country. I am the more particular in mentioning this to
your Excellency, because I apprehend these cases may
hereafter be frequent, and if the complaints are to be
addressed to you and me, we are likely to have a great
deal of trouble, as I am informed that it is become a daily
practice for outward bound English ships to put into Ostend,
make a formal pretended sale of ship and cargo to a
merchant of the place, who furnishes imperial papers for
the voyage under his own name, and receives a certain
sum per cent for the operation.</p>

<p>This is said to be a branch of great profit to the Flemish
merchants, and that a very great number of English
ships are now at sea with such papers, and I suspect even
from their own manner of stating the transaction, that the
ship and cargo reclaimed by the complainants are of that
kind. This seems to me an abuse of the neutrality, as
these fictitious profits are added to the advantage of real
carriage for the belligerent nations, they make it too much
the interest of neutral neighbors to foment wars and obstruct
peace, that such profits may continue. And if it is to be
understood as a settled point, that such papers are to
protect English property, the fitters out of privateers from
France, Spain, Holland, and America, will in another
year be all ruined, for they will find none but Flemish
ships upon the ocean.</p>

<p>With the greatest respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, January 23d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>An express just going to the Chesapeake, gives me an
opportunity of sending by the Hermione, a resolution
passed yesterday. My letters by this conveyance are so
long, that they leave me nothing to add, unless it be, that
we have just received letters from Mr Deane, (copies are
enclosed) which confirm the authenticity of those published
in his name by Mr Rivington, mentioned in my former
letters. In one of those publications he expressly advises
a return to the government of Great Britain; and, as this
could not be effected through Congress, that it should be
done by committees, which the people should choose for
that express purpose. These, of which I now send you
copies, were delivered here by the person to whom Mr
Deane gave them, so that there can be no doubt of their
authenticity.</p>

<p>We have nothing new except what you will learn from
the papers herewith transmitted. As I doubt not you are
upon the most confidential terms with the Marquis de Lafayette,
I could wish him to see my last letter. You will
observe, that I have omitted (for reasons, that you will
easily conceive) to make use of the arguments, which may
be derived from the 11th and 12th articles of our treaty
with France. The Commissioners will exercise their own
discretion in applying them, when a negotiation shall be
opened.</p>

<p>We were much surprised at not receiving a single line
by the frigate, which lately arrived at the Chesapeake,
from any one of our foreign Ministers. It is upwards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
three months since we have had a letter of intelligence
from Europe. Congress complains of these neglects, (for such
they consider them) and I flatter myself, that in future, as
a channel is now open through this office for a regular
correspondence, this cause of complaint will be removed,
and that letters and papers will be lodged with our consuls
to go by every conveyance.</p>

<p>Be persuaded, Sir, that I shall omit no opportunity to
give you every information, which may contribute to your
private amusements or the public benefit.</p>

<p class="close">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> I have this moment received resolutions from
Congress, (copies of which I enclose), which serve
to show their sense of the importance of the fisheries
and their western extent, and add new weight to the
arguments which I had the honor to urge. You will be
pleased to transmit copies of them to Mr Jay and Mr
Adams.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, January 24th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received yours of the 15th instant this day. I must
take the earliest opportunity of setting you right in one mistake,
which runs through your whole letter, and which to
you, under that mistake, must be a very delicate point.
You seem to apprehend that America has been stated in
the proposition to Lord North, as "disposed to enter into
a separate treaty with Great Britain;" but you meet the
condition, viz. in the words immediately following, "<em>and</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
<em>that their allies were disposed to consent to it</em>." There
cannot possibly be any supposition of treachery to allies, in
any proposition to which they may <em>consent</em>. A separate
treaty, with the <em>consent</em> of the allies of America, was the
proposition communicated to me by Mr Alexander, and
which I laid before the Minister, and which I reported
back again to Mr Alexander in writing, when I showed him
the paper entitled "Conciliatory Propositions," which I
took care to reduce to writing, with a view of avoiding mistakes;
therefore, I have not <em>misunderstood</em> Mr Alexander.
I have since seen Mr A. many times, and he has always
stated one and the same proposition, viz. that America
was disposed to enter into a separate treaty, because
their <em>allies were disposed to consent that they should</em>;
therefore there cannot exist a suspicion of treachery. It
occurred to me once while I was writing, to bar against
that misconstruction, but having specified the <em>consent of
the allies of America</em> in the same sentence, I could not
conceive such a misconstruction to have been possible.</p>

<p>You have mistaken another point greatly. You say,
"a truce for <em>ten</em> years." There is not in the bill any such
disposition or thought; on the contrary, it is specified in
the enclosed paper that it is kept <em>indefinite</em>, for the sole
purpose of avoiding the suspicion which you have suggested.
The truce may be for twenty, or fifty, or one
hundred years; in my opinion the longer the better.
But in any case, what I mean now to state is the <em>indefinite</em>
term in the bill. The articles of intercourse are only proposed
for ten years certain, just to strew the way with inviting
and conciliatory facilities, in the hope that <em>a little
time given for cooling</em> would confirm a perpetual peace.
If I were permitted to be the mediator, I should certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
propose the truce for twenty years; but if no more than
ten years could be obtained, I would certainly not refuse
such a ground of pacification and treaty. I refer you
to several of my letters two or three years ago, for the
justification of my sentiments on that head.</p>

<p>Another point; look at all my letters since 1778, and
see if I have at any time suggested any breach of treaty or
of honor; on the contrary, I think a faithless nation, if exterminated,
would not deserve the pity of mankind. I
speak of all I know in the treaty between America
and France, and what I think reasonable upon the case itself.
If America is further bound than we know of, they must
abide by it. I speak to the apparent and public foundation
of the treaty, article second, with the provision of
<em>tacitly</em>, from article eighth; and now I refer you to my
letter to you, as long ago as April 10th, 1779; "If beyond
this essential and directed end, and upon grounds totally
unconnected with that alliance, not upon motives of magnanimity
<em>for the relief of an innocent people</em>, but from distinct
and unconnected motives of private European sentiments,
America should be dragged into the consequence
of a general European war, she may apply to France
the apostrophe of the poet, speaking in the person of
Helen to Paris, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non hoc pollicitus tuæ</i>." You see, therefore,
that our sentiments have been uniform, and as I think,
reasonable, because I still remain in those sentiments.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, (and you may call it the case of
a straw if you please) that Great Britain and France should
continue the war for ten years, on the point of a commissary
at Dunkirk, aye or no;&mdash;would it be <em>reasonable</em>,
or a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus f&oelig;deris</i>, that America should be precluded
from a separate treaty for ten years, and therefore involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in the consequential war, after the <em>essential and
direct ends</em> of the treaty of February 6th, 1778, were
accomplished? As far as my judgment goes, upon the
knowledge of such facts as are public, I should think
it was neither <em>reasonable</em> nor a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus f&oelig;deris</i>. This is
the breviate of the argument, in which there is no thought
or suggestion of any breach of faith or honor. I did conclude
that France was disposed to give their <em>consent</em>, because
Mr Alexander informed me so, and because I
thought it reasonable that France should consent, and
reasonable that America should enjoy the benefit of that
consent. I transmitted it to Lord North, as a proposition
temperate and pacific on the part of America, and consented
to by their allies, and on no other ground did I
transmit or propose it. All that your letter tells me, is,
"that America will not break with her allies, and that her
Commissioners will not entertain such a thought;" but give
me leave to add, that they, as honest men, cannot disdain
such a thought more than I do; every honest man ought
to disdain the office, or the thought of proposing a breach
of faith to them. I have often told you, that such an
office or such a thought shall never be mine.</p>

<p>But you have not told me that France would not be
disposed to consent to a separate treaty of peace, for that
ally whose peace was the original declared object of the
alliance, in the case supposed, viz. of certain supposed
or real punctillios between two proud and belligerent nations,
which might possibly involve America for years in
a war totally unconnected with the objects of the alliance.
Besides, if any rubs should occur in the road to a general
peace, France is too proud a nation to say, that beyond
the <em>policy</em> of contributing to the separation of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
from Great Britain in any contest of rivalship, they cannot
meet their rivals in war, without the assistance of
America. I cannot conceive that the Minister of a great
belligerent nation could entertain such a thought, as affecting
their own sense of honor, or be so unreasonable to
their allies, as to withhold consent to their peace, when <em>the
essential and direct ends</em> of the alliance were satisfied.
Observe, I do not contend against a general peace; on the
contrary, I mean to recommend the most prudent means
for producing it. But, as an anxious lover of peace, I feel
terrors which dismay me, and I consider the dangers
which may obstruct a general peace, arising from the
pride and prejudices of nations, which are not to be controlled
in their heat by arguments of reason or philosophy.</p>

<p>Can any man in reason and philosophy tell me, why
any two nations in the world are called natural enemies, as
if it were the ordinance of God and nature? I fear it is too
deeply engraved in the passions of man, and for that
reason I would elude and evade the contest with such passions.
I would strew the road to peace with flowers, and
not with thorns. <em>Haughty</em>, and <em>dictating</em>, and <em>commands</em>,
are no words of mine; I abhor them, and I fear them. I
would elude their force by gentle means, and step by step.
In article eighth, there are the following words; "By the
treaty or treaties that shall terminate the war." Let us
have one treaty begun, and I think the rest would follow.
I fear when contending passions are raised, lest we should
lose all by grasping at too much.</p>

<p><em>January 25th.</em> I have just seen Mr Alexander, and
have talked the matter over with him. I send you a copy
of his sentiments upon it, which, for the sake of avoiding
further mistakes, he committed to paper, and which, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
think, justify me in saying, that I understood from him, that
France was <em>disposed to give their consent</em>, as he <em>explained</em>
it to me, and as I explained it to the Minister. He did not
say, nor did I understand him to say, that he was <em>authorised</em>
by the French Ministry, or by any one else, to declare that
France had bound herself to consent, or that any such
requisition had been made to her; but that it was his opinion
that France would consent, and that I might proceed
upon that presumption, so far as to recommend overtures
of negotiation. Accordingly, the phrase of my letter to
you is, that he <em>explained</em> to me, <em>that their allies were disposed
to consent</em>. You see what his opinion is on this
day; and as you have not told me that France will consent,
the <em>reasonable</em> probability which still remains with
me, for the hopes of opening an amicable treaty, remains
as it did.</p>

<p>I could not delay saying thus by the very first mail,
upon a point equally delicate to me as well as to yourself.
My dear friend, I beg of you not to think, either that you
can be considered as capable of entertaining, or that I
should be capable of suggesting any unworthy or dishonorable
propositions. If there has been any misunderstanding,
it is now cleared up; and the ground for negotiation remains
open as before. I therefore still entertain my hopes.</p>

<p class="close">
I am ever your affectionate,</p>

<p>As I had not the opportunity of seeing your correspondence
at this time, I was unable to prevent the misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that seems to have arisen. There is no proposition
of which I am more convinced, than that, "Nothing
can be done without the concurrence of allies." But, as
the chief obstruction towards an accommodation seemed to
me to lie in the personal character of some, who have great
weight in this matter, and as the object of the war (the independence
of America) seems, in the opinion of all men,
to be secured, my own opinion was, and still is, that there
was so much wisdom and moderation where prejudice
prevents us from seeing it, that, provided the ends of the
war are accomplished to the satisfaction of all parties, they
will be very ready to let us out of it in the most gentle
manner, by consenting equally that the business shall go on
in one, two, or three separate deeds, as shall be most palatable
here; and to doubt that our friends are desirous of
finishing the contest, with the approbation of their allies, is
to doubt their understanding.</p>

<h3>THE DANISH MINISTER TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="head">
Paris, February 6th, 1782.
</p>

<p>Three American vessels, one of which was three masted,
and called the Norfolk, Captain Lines, and two brigs, the
Ariel, Captain Maller, and the Virginia, Captain Hodsheadson,
all three armed in Philadelphia, committed a most
grievous outrage on the 2d of December last on the coast
of Norway, where they seized two English merchantmen
and burnt them, after plundering them and sending away
their crews. The circumstances are more particularly detailed
in the protest enclosed, made on the spot.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
moreover been proved by the report of his Danish Majesty's
grand bailiff at Christiansand, that the aforesaid American
vessels having anchored in the port of Fleckeroe, before
their meeting with the Englishmen, and displayed
French colors, he had asked of the French Consul information
respecting their sea papers, and that the latter, on
examining their contents, declared that they were not furnished
with any letters of marque on the part of Congress.
Their conduct proves this also in having burnt their prizes,
notwithstanding the offers of ransom made them by the
English captains. It therefore follows, that they can only
be considered as pirates, whose crimes are greatly aggravated
by a manifest infraction of his Danish Majesty's territorial
rights.</p>

<p>The undersigned, his Envoy Extraordinary, has received
precise orders to communicate these particulars to his Excellency,
the Count de Vergennes, requesting with every
possible confidence the intervention of his Most Christian
Majesty with the United States of America, to effect not
only the punishment of the guilty persons, but also to obtain
an indemnification for the vessels and cargoes that were
burnt, of which an exact statement shall be furnished; and
this satisfaction is due to repair the excesses committed on
his Majesty's territory.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, February 13th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>We have been extremely alarmed at some communications,
which the Minister of France made me from his last
letters. They look extremely as if the Count de Vergennes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
imagined, that neither Spain nor Holland was anxious for
our success. They discourage the idea of a loan from
them, or even from France. Our letters from Holland
confirm these conjectures, so far as they relate to that
State. Mr Adams seems almost to despair of doing anything
with respect to an alliance or loan, and from Mr Jay
we have heard nothing in a very long time, and are ignorant
of any steps he may have taken since the appointment
of M. Del Campo to treat with him.</p>

<p>These mortifying disappointments oblige us, though reluctantly,
to call upon France for further assistance. Your
solicitations will be infinitely useful to your country, if they
procure for it what I will venture to pronounce essential to
their safety. In this spirit, the instruction, which I do myself
the honor to enclose, has passed Congress, and a
second resolution, which I also enclose, which leads to such
information as will enable you to convince the Court of
France, that their navy can nowhere be more effectually
employed to distress the common enemy than in America.
I own this consideration is a great relief to my feelings,
when we make these importunate demands for money;
and I hope it will enable you to press them with some degree
of dignity.</p>

<p>That France can aid us is not to be doubted, for it
is certain she never carried on a war that distressed her
finances less. She has no expensive subsidies to pay;
her money is expended either at home, or in a country
from which it returns. Her army is not greatly increased,
and her commerce under the protection of her fleets enjoys
a security, that it seldom has experienced before. I
would not, however, have you suppose, that this is the
language I hold here. I know too well the necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
making every exertion, which in our present impoverished
situation we are capable of; and I neglect no means,
which my present station puts in my power to call forth.</p>

<p>Congress have taken every wise measure for that purpose,
and I firmly persuade myself, that we shall be able
to form the most vigorous co-operation with such force as
his Majesty may please to send out. I am confident that
the peace must be made in America. Every blow here is
fatal to the grand object of the present war; to the hopes,
to the wishes, and to the pride of Great Britain. Other
conquests she expects to have restored upon a peace;
what is lost here she knows to be lost forever.</p>

<p>The daily complaints that we receive from seamen confined
in England concur with humanity, and the national
honor, to render some expedient for their relief necessary.
I need not, I am persuaded, recommend this to your particular
care. We have not yet obtained, at least as far as
I can learn, a compensation for the prisoners taken by Paul
Jones and returned to England. Is it impossible, either to
settle a cartel in Europe, or to have the Americans confined
there sent to New York for exchange? The last
proposition is so much in favor of England, that it would
probably be acceded to, and yet such is the distress of the
people who have been long confined, that it would be desirable
to have the offer made. I am just now applied to
by a Mrs Simmonds, whose husband is the mate of a vessel,
and has been two years confined in Mill Prison; it
would be an act of charity to attempt to procure his relief.
You will do me the favor to collect and transmit a list of
the numbers confined in England, and, as far as possible,
for the satisfaction of their friends, of the names.</p>

<p>We have not a word of intelligence to communicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
unless it be some little disturbances in the country, which
has been distinguished by the names of New Hampshire
Grants, and Vermont; and which it may be proper to
mention to you, since the facility with which the British deceive
themselves, and the address with which they deceive
others, may render it a matter of moment in Europe,
though in fact it is none in America. The bulk of the
people of that country are "<em>New England Presbyterian
Whigs</em>." Some of those, in possession of the powers of
government, have more address than principle. Finding
themselves exposed to inroads from Canada, they have
tampered with that government, and pretended to be willing
to form a treaty of neutrality with them during the war, and
to return to the obedience of Britain on a peace. This
has had the effect they intended, and in some measure defeated
an expedition, which the enemy made last year, and
retained their main body in inaction at Ticonderoga, while
the parties they sent to the westward were beaten and dispersed
by our militia. The secret has been discovered, is
disavowed by the people, and such measures are now
taken, that by the time the King of Great Britain and his
Council, (before whom the propositions now lie) have
formed a plan in consequence of them, they will be made
the means of drawing them into new difficulties.</p>

<p>I presume that you keep up a constant correspondence
with Mr Jay and Mr Adams, and assist them with your information
and advice. I must beg the favor of you to
transmit them this intelligence, that they may be prepared
to meet any assertions of the enemy on that head. I take
leave to repeat to you my desire to have the papers and
political publications sent regularly to this office.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, February 16th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received your favor of the 24th past. You have
taken pains to rectify a mistake of mine relating to the aim
of your letters. I accept kindly your replication, and I
hope you will excuse my error, when you reflect, that I
knew of no consent given by France to our treating separately
of peace, and that there has been mixed in some of
your conversations and letters various reasonings, to show,
that if France should require something of us that was unreasonable,
we then should not be obliged by our treaty to
join with her in continuing the war. As there had never
been such requisition, what could I think of such discourses?
I thought as I suppose an honest woman would
think, if a gallant should entertain her with suppositions of
cases, in which infidelity to her husband would be justifiable.
Would not she naturally imagine, seeing no other
foundation or motive for such conversation, that if he could
once get her to admit the general principle, his intended
next step would be to persuade her, that such a case actually
existed. Thus knowing your dislike of France,
and your strong desire of recovering America to England,
I was impressed with the idea, that such an infidelity on
our part would not be disagreeable to you; and that you
were therefore aiming to lessen in my mind the horror I
conceived at the idea of it. But we will finish here by
mutually agreeing, that neither you were capable of proposing,
nor I of acting on such principles.</p>

<p>I cannot however forbear endeavoring to give a little
possible utility to this letter, by saying something on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
case of Dunkirk. You do not see why two nations should
be deemed natural enemies to each other. Nor do I,
unless one or both of them are naturally mischievous and
insolent. But I can see how enmities long continued,
even during a peace, tend to shorten that peace, and to
rekindle a war; and this is when either party, having an
advantage in war, shall exact conditions in the treaty of
peace, that are goading and constantly mortifying to the
other. I take this to be the case of your "Commissioner
at Dunkirk." What would be your feelings if France
should take, and hold possession of Portsmouth, or Spain
of Plymouth, after a peace, as you formerly held Calais,
and now hold Gibraltar? Or on restoring your ports,
should insist on having an insolent Commissioner stationed
there, to forbid your placing one stone upon another by
way of fortification? You would probably not be very
easy under such a stipulation. If therefore you desire a
peace, that may be <em>firm</em> and durable, think no more of such
extravagant demands. It is not necessary to give my
opinion further on that point, yet I may add frankly, as
this is merely private conversation between you and me,
that I do think a faithful ally, especially when under obligations
for such great and generous assistance as we have
received, should fight as long as he is able, to prevent, as
far as his continuing to fight may prevent, his friends being
compelled again to suffer such an insult.</p>

<p>My dear friend, the true pains you are taking to restore
peace, whatever may be the success, entitle you to the
esteem of all good men. If your Ministers really desire
peace, methinks they would do well to <em>empower</em> some person
to make propositions for that purpose. One or other
of the parties at war must take the first step. To do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
belongs properly to the wisest. America being a novice
in such affairs, has no pretence to that character; and indeed,
after the answer given by Lord Stormont (when we
proposed to him something relative to the mutual treatment
of prisoners with humanity) that "<em>the King's Ministers receive
no applications from rebels, unless when they come to
implore his Majesty's clemency</em>," it cannot be expected,
that we should hazard the exposing ourselves again to such
insolence. All I can say further at present is, that in my
opinion your enemies do not aim at your destruction, and
that if you propose a treaty you will find them reasonable
in their demands, provided that on your side they meet with
the same good dispositions. But do not dream of dividing
us; you will certainly never be able to effect it.</p>

<p>With great regard and affection, I am ever, dear Sir,
your most obedient and most humble servant,</p>

February 28th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I have not as yet anything to communicate to you. I
have upon many occasions recommended the road to peace
in the most earnest way. I am not without hopes. I
think I may venture to say, that the arguments which I
have stated have made an impression. I have not expected
to receive the final answer from Lord North, till after the
Parliamentary arrangements of the year are settled. I
am just for three or four days in the country, upon a little
business, but upon a furlough, as I may say, with the knowledge
of Lord North, who, during the budget week, cannot
possibly want to see me. I have therefore taken that
week for a little private business in the country, and if
Lord North should happen to wish to see me, my brother
keeps watch, and is to send express for me. Public report
will tell you, that on Friday last there was a division
in the house on an American question, of one hundred and
ninetyfour to one hundred and ninetythree.</p>

<p>I cannot answer for the dispositions of Ministers, but in
point of justice I ought to say, that I think, and as far as I
can judge from the conferences which I have had, that I
have found good dispositions towards peace. I do not
pledge myself, because I may be deceived; however, that
is my opinion; and I say thus much lest my silence should
appear suspicious, and create alienation in other parties.
I think I have seen good dispositions from the first commencement
of my conferences on peace. My brother
sends me word, that Mr Alexander is to return by the
next mail. I therefore write this to send either by him or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
at least in the same packet. I have had much conversation
with him, and he will tell you that I have done my
utmost to serve the cause of peace. I will conclude this
with a quotation, which I have applied to another person in
argument respecting peace.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 3d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter your Excellency did me the honor
of writing to me, the 24th past, enclosing an official paper
on the part of the Danish Court, relating to the burning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
some English vessels on the coast of Norway, by three
American ships. I shall not fail to transmit the same immediately
to the Congress, who will, I make no doubt,
inquire into the facts alleged, and do thereupon what shall
appear to be just and right, it being their constant and
earnest desire to avoid giving any offence to neutral
nations, as will appear by their instructions to all armed
vessels, of which I have the honor to present a copy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as it is natural to expect, that those
who exact a rigorous observation of the laws of nations
when their own interest or honor seems affected, should be
themselves ready to show an example of their own regard
for those laws, where the interest of others is concerned,
I cannot but hope the Court of Denmark will at length
attend to a demand, long since made by me, but hitherto
without effect, that they would restore to the United
States the value of three vessels, amounting to fifty thousand
pounds sterling. These vessels were fair and good
prizes, which had been made by our ships of war, not on
the coast of Denmark, but far distant on the high seas, and
were sent into Bergen as into a port truly neutral, but
there, contrary to the laws of hospitality, as well as the
other laws of nations, they were forcibly wrested out of
our hands by the government of that place, and delivered
back to our enemies. The Congress have not lost sight
of this violence, but constantly expected justice from the
equity and wisdom of his Danish Majesty.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 4th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Since I wrote the two short letters, of which I herewith
send you copies, I have been honored with yours, dated
the 16th of December.</p>

<p>Enclosed I send two letters from Count de Vergennes,
relating to certain complaints from Ostend and Copenhagen
against our cruisers. I formerly forwarded a similar
complaint from Portugal, to which I have yet received no
answer. The Ambassador of that kingdom frequently
teazes me for it. I hope now that by your means this
kind of affairs will be more immediately attended to; ill
blood and mischief may be thereby sometimes prevented.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette was at his return hither received
by all ranks with all possible distinction. He daily
gains in the general esteem and affection, and promises to
be a great man here. He is warmly attached to our
cause; we are on the most friendly and confidential footing
with each other, and he is really very serviceable to
me in my applications for additional assistance.</p>

<p>I have done what I could in recommending Messieurs
Duportail and Gouvion, as you desired. I did it with
pleasure, as I have much esteem for them.</p>

<p>I will endeavor to procure a sketch of an emblem for
the purpose you mention. This puts me in mind of a
medal I have had a mind to strike, since the late great
event you gave me an account of, representing the United
States by the figure of an infant Hercules in his cradle,
strangling the two serpents; and France by that of Minerva,
sitting by as his nurse, with her spear and helmet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and her robe specked with a few <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs de lis</i>. The extinguishing
of two entire armies in one war is what has
rarely happened, and it gives a presage of the future force
of our growing empire.</p>

<p>I thank you much for the newspapers you have been
so kind as to send me. I send also to you, by every
opportunity, packets of the French, Dutch, and English
papers. Enclosed is the last <cite>Courier of Europe</cite>, wherein
you will find a late curious debate on continuing the war
with America, which the Minister carried in the affirmative
only by his own vote. It seems the nation is sick of
it; but the King is obstinate. <em>There is a change made of
the American Secretary</em>, and another is talked of in the
room of Lord Sandwich. But I suppose we have no
reason to desire such changes. If the King will have a
war with us, his old servants are as well for us as any he
is likely to put in their places. The Ministry you will see
declare, that the war in America is for the future to be
only <em>defensive</em>. I hope we shall be too prudent to have
the least dependence on this declaration. It is only thrown
out to lull us; for, depend upon it, the King hates us cordially,
and will be content with nothing short of our extirpation.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to receive the account you are preparing
of the wanton damages done our possessions. I wish you
could also furnish me with one, of the barbarities committed
on our people. They may both be of excellent use on
certain occasions. I received the duplicate of yours in
cypher. Hereafter, I wish you would use that in which
those instructions were written, that relate to the future
peace. I am accustomed to that, and I think it very good
and more convenient in the practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>The friendly disposition of this Court towards us continues.
We have sometimes pressed a little too hard,
expecting, and demanding, perhaps, more than we ought,
and have used improper arguments, which may have occasioned
a little dissatisfaction, but it has not been lasting.
In my opinion, the surest way to obtain liberal aid from
others, is vigorously to help ourselves. People fear assisting
the negligent, the indolent, and the careless, lest the
aids they afford should be lost. I know we have done a
great deal, but it is said we are apt to be supine after a
little success, and too backward in furnishing our contingents.
This is really a generous nation, fond of glory, and
particularly that of protecting the oppressed. Trade is
not the admiration of their noblesse, who always govern
here. Telling them their <em>commerce</em> will be advantaged by
our success, and that it is their <em>interest</em> to help us, seems
as much as to say, help us, and we shall not be obliged to
you. Such indiscreet and improper language has been
sometimes held here by some of our people, and produced
no good effects.</p>

<p>The constant harmony subsisting between the armies of
the two nations in America, is a circumstance that has
afforded me infinite pleasure. It should be carefully cultivated.
I hope nothing will happen to disturb it. The
French officers, who have returned to France this winter,
speak of our people in the handsomest and kindest manner;
and there is a strong desire in many of the young
noblemen to go over to fight for us; there is no restraining
some of them; and several changes among the officers
of their army have lately taken place in consequence.</p>

<p>You must be so sensible of the utility of maintaining a
perfect good understanding with the Chevalier de la Luzerne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that I need say nothing on that head. The affairs
of a distant people in any Court of Europe will always be
much affected, by the representations of the Minister of
that Court residing among them.</p>

<p>We have here great quantities of supplies, of all kinds,
ready to be sent over, and which would have been on their
way before this time, if the unlucky loss of the transports,
that were under M. de Guichen, and other demands for
more ships, had not created a difficulty to find freight for
them. I hope, however, that you will receive them with
the next convoy.</p>

<p>The accounts we have of the economy introduced by
Mr. Morris begin to be of service to us here, and will by
degrees obviate the inconvenience, that an opinion of our
disorders and mismanagements had occasioned. I inform
him by this conveyance of the money aids we shall have
this year. The sum is not so great as we could wish; and
we must so much the more exert ourselves. A small increase
of industry in every American, male and female,
with a small diminution of luxury, would produce a sum
far superior to all we can hope to beg or borrow from all
our friends in Europe.</p>

<p>There are now near a thousand of our brave fellows
prisoners in England, many of whom have patiently endured
the hardships of that confinement several years,
resisting every temptation to serve our enemies. Will not
your late great advantages put it in your power to do
something for their relief? The slender supply I have
been able to afford, of a shilling a week to each, for their
greater comfort during the winter, amounts weekly to
£50 sterling. An exchange would make so many of our
countrymen happy, add to our strength, and diminish our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
expense. But our privateers who cruise in Europe will
not be at the trouble of bringing in their prisoners, and I
have none to exchange for them.</p>

<p>Generals Cornwallis and Arnold are both arrived in England.
It is reported, that the former, in all his conversations,
discourages the prosecution of the war in America;
if so, he will of course be out of favor. We hear much of
audiences given to the latter, and of his being present at
councils.</p>

<p>You desire to know whether any intercepted letters of
Mr Deane have been published in Europe? I have seen
but one in the English papers, that to Mr Wadsworth, and
none in any of the French and Dutch papers, but some may
have been printed, that have not fallen in my way. There
is no doubt of their being all genuine. His conversation,
since his return from America, has, as I have been informed,
gone gradually more and more into that style,
and at length come to an open vindication of Arnold's
conduct; and within these few days he has sent me a
letter of twenty full pages, recapitulating those letters, and
threatening to write and publish an account of the treatment
he has received from Congress, &amp;c. He resides at Ghent,
is distressed both in mind and circumstances, raves and
writes abundance, and I imagine it will end in his going
over to join his friend Arnold in England. I had an exceeding
good opinion of him when he acted with me, and
I believe he was then sincere and hearty in our cause.
But he is changed, and his character ruined in his own
country and in this, so that I see no other but England to
which he can now retire. He says that we owe him about
£12,000 sterling, and his great complaint is, that we do
not settle his accounts and pay him. Mr Johnston having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
declined the service, I proposed engaging Mr Searle to
undertake it, but Mr Deane objected to him, as being his
enemy. In my opinion he was, for that reason, even fitter
for the service of Mr Deane, since accounts are of a mathematical
nature, and cannot be changed by an enemy,
while that enemy's testimony, that he had found them well
supported by authentic vouchers, would have weighed
more than the same testimony from a friend.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>With regard to negotiations for a peace, I see but little
probability of their being entered upon seriously this year,
unless the English Minister had failed in raising his funds,
which it is said he has secured, so that we must provide
for another campaign, in which I hope God will continue
to favor us, and humble our cruel and haughty enemies; a
circumstance which, whatever Mr Deane may say to the
contrary, will give pleasure to all Europe.</p>

<p>This year opens well, by the reduction of Port Mahon,
and the garrison prisoners of war, and we are not without
hopes, that Gibraltar may soon follow. A few more signal
successes in America will do much towards reducing our
enemies to reason. Your expressions of good opinion with
regard to me, and wishes of my continuance in this employment,
are very obliging. As long as the Congress think
I can be useful to our affairs, it is my duty to obey their
orders; but I should be happy to see them better executed
by another, and myself at liberty, enjoying, before I quit
the stage of life, some small degree of leisure and tranquillity.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 9th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received the honor of yours dated January
the 7th. Your communications of the sentiments of Congress,
with regard to many points that may come under
consideration in a treaty of peace, give me great pleasure,
and the more, as they agree so perfectly with my own
opinions, and furnish me with additional arguments in their
support. I shall be more particular on this subject in my
next, for having notice from Captain Barry last night, that
he will not go to Brest, as I expected, to take in some of
our goods, but will sail immediately on the return of the
post, which sets out today, I am obliged to be short.</p>

<p>You will see in the enclosed newspapers the full debate
in the House of Commons, on the subject of declining the
war with North America. By private advices I learn,
that the whole opposition, now become the majority, went
up in a body with the address to the King, who answered
that he would pay a due regard to the advice of his faithful
Commons, and employ his forces with more vigor
against the ancient enemies of the nation, or to that purpose;
and that orders were immediately given for taking
up a great number of large transports, among which are
many old India ships, whence it is conjectured, that they
intend some great effort in the West Indies, and perhaps
mean to carry off their troops and stores from New York
and Charleston. I hope, however, that we shall not, in
expectation of this, relax in our preparations for the approaching
campaign. I will procure the books you write
for, and send them as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>Present my duty to the Congress, and believe me to be,

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, March 11th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>Mr Digges, who will deliver this to you, informs me,
that having been applied to for the purpose of communicating
with Mr Adams, on the subject of his commission
for treating of peace, he is now setting out for Amsterdam,
and that he intends afterwards to go to Paris to wait upon
you. I understand the occasion to have arisen, by some
mention having been made in Parliament by General Conway,
of persons not far off having authority to treat of
peace, which was supposed to allude to Mr Adams, and
some friends of his in London. The Ministry were therefore
induced to make some inquiries themselves. This is
what I am informed of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>When the proposal was made to Mr Digges, he consulted
me, I believe from motives of caution, that he might
know what ground he had to stand upon; but not in the
least apprized that I had been in any degree in course of
corresponding with you on the subject of negotiation. As
I had informed the Ministry from you, that other persons
besides yourself were invested with powers of treating, I
have nothing to say against their consulting the several
respective parties. That is their own concern. I shall at
all times content myself with observing the duties of my
own conduct, attending to all circumstances with circumspection,
and then leaving the conduct of others to their
own reasons. I presume that Ministry have only done
what others would have done in their situation, to procure
the most ample information that the case will admit. I
rest contented to act in my own sphere, and if my exertions
can be applied to any public good, I shall always be
ready to take my part with sincerity and zeal.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, March 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>Enclosed with this I transmit to you the public Parliamentary
proceedings respecting the American war. If
you will compare these proceedings with some others in
several of the counties of this kingdom about two years
ago, you will at once see the reason why many persons,
who from principles of general and enlarged philanthropy
do most certainly wish universal peace to mankind, yet
seem restrained in their mode of endeavoring to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that object. We must accommodate our endeavors to
practicabilities, in the strong hope, that if the work of
peace was once begun, it would soon become general.
Parliament having declared their sentiments by their public
proceedings; a general bill will soon pass to enable
administration to treat with America, and to conclude.</p>

<p>As to the sincerity of the Ministry, that will be judged of
by their conduct in any treaty. The first object is to procure
a meeting of qualified and authorised persons. You
have told me that four persons are empowered by a special
commission to treat of peace. Are we to understand that
each separately has power to conclude, or in what manner?
The four persons whom you have mentioned are in
four different parts of the world, viz. three of them are in
hostile States, and the fourth under circumstances very
peculiar for a negotiator. When I told Mr Laurens that
his name was in the commission, I found him entirely
ignorant of every circumstance relating to it. I understand
that the Ministry will be ready to proceed towards
opening a negotiation as soon as the bill shall pass, and
therefore it is necessary to consult time, and place, and
manner, and persons, on each side. The negotiation itself
will speak the rest.</p>

<p>I have been informed, that some gentlemen in this country
(not in administration) have lately entered into a correspondence
with Mr Adams, relating to his commission
of treating for peace, and that then previous inquiries
having been spoken of in public, the Ministry have been
induced to make some inquiry themselves from Mr Adams
on that subject. In whatever way a fair treaty may
be opened, by whomsoever or with whomsoever, I shall
heartily wish good success to it for the common good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
peace of mankind. I know these to be your sentiments,
and I am confident that they will ever remain so, and hope
that you will believe the same of me.</p>

<p class="close">
I am ever your most affectionate,</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, March 21st, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>You will have heard before this can reach you, that
Lord North declared yesterday in the House of Commons,
that his Majesty intended to change his Ministers.
The House is adjourned for a few days to give time for
the formation of a new Ministry. Upon this occasion,
therefore, I must apply to you, to know whether you
would wish me to transfer the late negotiation to the successors
of the late Ministry; in these terms; (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> yours
to me of January 15th, 1782,) viz. "that you are empowered
by a special commission to treat of peace, whenever
a negotiation for that purpose shall be opened. That
it must be always understood, that it is to be in conjunction
with your allies, conformable to the solemn treaties
made with them. That the formal acknowledgment of
the independence of America is not made necessary."
And may I add, that upon these terms you are disposed
to enter into a negotiation. It is not known who will
succeed the late Ministry, but from the circumstances
which preceded its dissolution, we are to hope that they
will be disposed to enter into a negotiation of peace, upon
fair and honorable terms. I have no doubt that there
were some persons in the late Ministry of that disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>I told you in my last letters to you, of the 11th and
12th instant, that I had received information, whilst I was
in the course of correspondence with the Ministry myself,
on the subject of peace, that some part of the Ministry
were transmitting some communications or inquiries upon
that subject with Mr Adams, unknown to me. I had informed
the Ministry from you, of the names of the four
persons empowered to treat. I saw the Minister upon the
occasion. (I should now call him the late Minister.) I
took the liberty of giving him my opinion upon the matter
itself. So far as it related personally to me, I expressed
myself fully to him, that there was no occasion that such
a step should have been taken unknown to me, for that
I was very free to confess, that if they thought my partiality
towards peace was so strong, that they could drive a
better bargain through another channel, I could not have
any right of exclusion upon them. I relate this to you,
because I would wish to have you make a corresponding
application to your own case. If you should think <em>that
my strong desire for peace</em>, although <em>most laudable and
virtuous in itself, should mislead me</em>, and that my being as
you may suppose misled, may be of any prejudice to the
cause committed to your trust, I desire by no means to
embarrass your free conduct by any considerations of private
or personal regard to myself. Having said thus
much, I will now add, that I am not unambitious of the
office of a peace maker; that I flatter myself the very
page which I am now writing will bear full testimony from
both sides, of the impartiality of my conduct. And I will
add once more, what I often said and repeated to each
side, viz. that no fallacy or deception, knowing, or suspecting
it to be such, shall ever pass through my hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>Believe me, I sympathise most cordially and sincerely
with you in every anxiety of yours for peace. I hope
things are tending (although not without rubs) yet in the
main, to that end&mdash;soon! as soon as the course of human
life may be expected to operate on the great scale and
course of national events, or rather in the creation and
establishment of a new world. I am sometimes tempted
to think myself in patient expectation the elder sage of
the two; I say the elder, not the better.</p>

<h3>T. DIGGES TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, March 22d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I left England a few days back, and until my conversation
and some consultations with Mr Adams, on a matter which
will be mentioned to you by him, and more particularly
explained in this letter, my determination was to have seen
you, as well on that business as on a matter of much
consequence to my private reputation. I feel the disadvantages
under which I labor, when writing to you on a
matter, which cannot be explained or cleared up but by
personal conversation. I do not give up my intended purpose
of personally speaking to you; but it being found
better and more convenient to my purpose to return immediately
hence to England, and from thence to Paris,
in preference to going first to Paris, it must be unavoidably
delayed for some days.</p>

<p>It would take up more than the length of a letter to explain
the whole opening and progression of a matter I am
here upon, which was and is meant to be jointly communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to you with Mr Adams; I will therefore take the
liberty to give you an abbreviation of it in as few words as
I can.</p>

<p>About a fortnight ago a direct requisition from the Ministry,
through Lord Beauchamp, was made to Mr R. Penn,
to know if he could ascertain <em>that any person or persons in
Europe were commissioned by Congress to treat for peace,
whether they were</em> now <em>willing to avail themselves of such
commission, and of the present sincere disposition in the
Ministry to treat, and whether they would receive an appointed
Commissioner to speak for a truce, and mention a
place for the meeting, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p>Mr Penn's referring Lord Beauchamp to me, as knowing
the nature of Mr Adams's former commission, was
the sole cause of my being privy to, or a party, in the
matter. I had various meetings with Lord Beauchamp
in company with Mr Penn on the subject; the particular
memorandums of which, and Lord Beauchamp's statement
of what the Ministry wanted to obtain, together with
every other circumstance relative to the matter, I regularly
consulted Mr Laurens and Mr D. Hartley upon;
and the result was, my taking the journey hither, and to
Paris, in order to put the questions (as they are before
stated from Lord B. to Mr Penn) and to bring an answer
thereto. I am well convinced, by Lord Beauchamp's
pledge of his personal honor, as well as from Mr Hartley's
telling me he knew the matter to come directly from Lord
North, (for he visited him more than once to ascertain the
fact) that it is a serious and sincere requisition from the
Ministry, and that they will immediately take steps to open
a treaty, provided I go back with assurances, that there is
a power vested in Americans in Europe to treat and conclude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and that they are willing to avail themselves of such
power when properly applied to.</p>

<p>I have stated the whole transaction to Mr Adams, read
every memorandum I had made, informed him of every
circumstance I knew, and when I put the questions (as
they are before stated from Lord Beauchamp to Mr Penn)
he replied, "that there were certainly Commissioners in
Europe, of which body he was one, who had powers to
treat and conclude upon peace; that he believed them
willing to enter into such a treaty, provided a proper offer
was made; but that no questions now, or to be made in
future, could be answered by him, without previously consulting
his colleagues, and afterwards acquainting the Ministers
of the belligerent powers thereof." Mr Adams
recommended that any future questions might be made
directly to you, for that the present, as well as any subsequent
propositions, would be immediately communicated
to you and to M. de Vergennes.</p>

<p>His answers to my questions were nearly what I foretold
and expected, and are substantially what Lord Beauchamp
seemed so anxious to procure. When I relate this
answer to his Lordship, my business will be finished in
that quarter. I will here explain to you my only motive
for being a messenger from him, whom I had never known
nor been in company with before. It will enable me to
say, "I have done one favor for you, and I claim of you
another, viz. to obtain a restoration of my papers from
Lord Hillsborough's office, which were in a most illegal
and unjustifiable manner seized from me near a twelvemonth
ago, and are yet withheld, notwithstanding the
personal applications for them from Lord Coventry, Lord
Nugent, and Mr Jackson, each of whom has explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the injury and very extraordinary mischief the want of my
papers for so long a time has and is now doing me."</p>

<p>On my first conversation with Mr Adams, I had concluded
to go to you, partly by his advice to do so, but as
the expense of two journeys, where one may serve, is of
some import to me, and from supposing your answer would
be substantially the same as that from Mr Adams, I have
thought it better to go back immediately to London, and
then set out for Paris, with the probability of being able
to bear my papers.</p>

<p>I will take the liberty to trouble you with another
letter, if anything occurs on my arrival in London. I
am to leave this with Mr Adams for forwardance; and
for the present, I have only to beg a line acknowledging
the receipt of it. If your letter is put under a cover
to Mr Stockdale, Bookseller, Piccadilly, London, it will
the more readily get to hand.</p>

<p>I am, with great respect, Sir, your very obedient servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
T. DIGGES.
</p>

<p><em>P. S. Ostend, March 26th.</em>&mdash;On my last visit to Mr
Adams, Friday evening, to explain to him the substance of
the foregoing letter, and ask his forwardance of it to you,
we had some further conversation on the matter, the
ultimate conclusion of which was, that it was thought
better I did not send the annexed letter to you, or mention
my business with him, until my going in person from England.
Mr Adams's reasons were these. That if I made
the communication <em>then</em>, he should be necessitated to state
the matter in a long letter to you and others of his colleagues;
that the matter as it then stood was not of such
importance, but he could save himself the trouble of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
explanation; and that as he recommended any future
questions or applications to be made directly to you, your
situation making it more convenient sooner to inform the
French Court thereof, he thought my letter had better
be postponed, and the substance of it given in person as
soon as I could possibly get from London to Paris. I
acquiesced, though reluctantly, and having thought much
on the matter on my journey hither, I have at length determined
to forward the foregoing letter with this postscript,
and at the same time to inform Mr Adams of my exact
feelings on the matter, viz. that my wishes and intentions,
which, when I left England, were to see and make known
the matter to you, that through Mr Hartley or some other
channel you must hear that I had been at Amsterdam,
and my seemingly turning my back upon you might be
thought oddly of; and finally, that I could not answer for
carrying the enclosure from Mr Hartley back to England,
not knowing the consequence it might be of. I hope and
think I have done right in this matter.</p>

<p>The purpose for my moving in the business I went to
Mr Adams upon, has, I own, been with a double view
of serving myself in a matter of much consequence to me,
for after delivering the explanations I carry, I can with
some degree of right, and a very great probability of success,
claim as a gratuity for the trouble and expense I
have been at, the restoration of my papers; the situation of
which I have already explained to Lord Beauchamp, in
order to get him to be a mover for them, and I have very
little doubt that a few days will restore them to me, and
give me an opportunity to speedily speak to you on a matter,
which gives me much uneasiness, vexation, and pain.
Excuse the hurry in which I write, for I am very near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the period of embarkation. Paul Wentworth embarked
this day for England. I trod on his heels the chief of
the way from the Hague, which he left suddenly. General
Fawcett is on his road hence to Hanover.</p>

<h3>JOHN ADAMS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
The Hague, March 26th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>One day last week I received at Amsterdam a card
from Mr Digges, enclosing two letters to me from David
Hartley. The card desired to see me upon business of
importance; and the letters from Mr Hartley contained an
assurance, that to his knowledge the bearer came from
the highest authority. I answered the card, that in the
present situation of affairs here and elsewhere, it was impossible
for me to see any one from England without
witness; but if he were willing to see me in the presence
of Mr Thaxter, my secretary, and that I should communicate
whatever he should say to me to Dr Franklin, and the
Count de Vergennes, I should wait for him at home at ten
o'clock; but that I had rather he should go to Paris without
seeing me, and communicate what he had to say to
Dr Franklin, whose situation enabled him to consult the
Court without any loss of time. At ten, however, he
came, and told me a long story about consultations with
Mr Penn, Mr Hartley, Lord Beauchamp, and at last Lord
North, by whom he was finally sent, to inquire of me, if I,
or any other, had authority to treat with Great Britain of a
truce. I answered, that "I came to Europe with full
powers to make peace, that those powers had been announced
to the public upon my arrival, and continued in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
force until last summer, when Congress sent a new commission,
containing the same powers to four persons, whom
I named; that if the King of England were my father,
and I the heir apparent to his throne, I could not advise
him ever to think of a truce, because it would be but a
real war under a simulated appearance of tranquillity, and
would end in another open and bloody war, without doing
any real good to any of the parties."</p>

<p>He said that "the Ministry would send some person of
consequence over, perhaps General Conway, but they
were apprehensive that he would be ill treated or exposed."
I said, "that if they resolved upon such a
measure, I had rather they would send immediately to Dr
Franklin, because of his situation near the French Court.
But there was no doubt, if they sent any respectable personage,
properly authorised, who should come to treat
honorably, he would be treated with great respect; but
that if he came to me, I could give him no opinion upon
anything without consulting my colleagues, and should
reserve a right of communicating everything to them, and
to our allies."</p>

<p>He then said, that "his mission was finished; that the
fact to be ascertained was simply, that there was a commission
in Europe to treat and conclude; but that there
was not one person in Great Britain, who could affirm or
prove that there was such a commission, although it had
been announced in the gazettes."</p>

<p>I desired him, and he promised me, not to mention Mr
Laurens to the Ministry without his consent, (and without
informing him, that it was impossible he should say
anything in the business, because he knew nothing of our
instructions) because, although it was possible that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
being in such a commission might induce them to release
him, yet it was also possible it might render them more
difficult concerning his exchange.</p>

<p>The picture he gives of the situation of things in England
is gloomy enough for them. The distresses of the
people, and the distractions in administration and Parliament,
are such as may produce any effect almost that can
be imagined.</p>

<p>The only use of all this I think is to strike the decisive
strokes at New York and Charleston. There is no position
so advantageous for negotiation, as when we have all
an enemy's army prisoners. I must beg the favor of you,
Sir, to send me, by one of the Count de Vergennes'
couriers to the Duc de la Vauguyon, a copy in letters of
your peace instructions. I have not been able to decypher
one quarter part of mine. Some mistake has
certainly been made.</p>

<p>Ten or eleven cities in Holland have declared themselves
in favor of American independence; and it is
expected that today or tomorrow this Province will take
the decisive resolution of admitting me to my audience.
Perhaps some of the other Provinces may delay it for
three or four weeks. But the Prince has declared, that
he has no hopes of resisting the torrent, and, <em>therefore</em>, that
he shall not attempt it. The Duc de la Vauguyon has

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 30th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In mine of the ninth instant I acknowledged the receipt
of yours of January 7th, and I have not since received any
of later date. The newspapers, which I send you by this
conveyance, will acquaint you with what has, since my last,
passed in Parliament. You will there see a copy of the
bill, brought in by the Attorney General, for empowering
the King to make peace with the colonies. They still
seem to flatter themselves with the idea of dividing us;
and rather than name the Congress, they empower him
generally to treat with any <em>body or bodies of men, or any
person or persons, &amp;c.</em> They are here likewise endeavoring
to get us to treat separately from France, at the same
time they are tempting France to treat separately from us,
equally without the least chance of success. I have been
drawn into a correspondence on this subject, which you
shall have with my next.</p>

<p>I send you a letter of Mr Adams's, just received, which
shows also that they are weary of the war, and would get
out of it if they knew how. They had not then received
the certain news of the loss of St Christopher's, which will
probably render them still more disposed to peace. I see
that a bill is also passing through the House of Commons,
for the exchange of American prisoners, the purport of
which I do not yet know.</p>

<p>In my last, I promised to be more particular with respect
to the points you mentioned, as proper to be insisted
on in the treaty of peace. My ideas on those points are,
I assure you, full as strong as yours. I did intend to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
given you my reasons for some addition, and if the treaty
were to be held on your side the water, I would do it;
otherwise, it seems on second thoughts to be unnecessary,
and, if my letter should be intercepted, may be inconvenient.
Be assured, I shall not willingly give up any important
right or interest of our country, and unless this
campaign should afford our enemies some considerable
advantage, I hope more may be obtained than is yet expected.</p>

<p>I have purchased for you all the books you desired, except
four, which we have sent for to England. I shall
request our excellent friend, the Marquis de Lafayette, to
take them under his care, and I hope they will get safe to
hand. The others shall follow by the first opportunity,
after I receive them.</p>

<p>Our affairs go on, generally, well in Europe. Holland
has been slow, Spain slower, but time will I hope smooth
away all difficulties. Let us keep up, not only our courage,
but our vigilance, and not be laid asleep by the pretended
half peace the English make with us without asking
our consent. We cannot be safe while they keep armies
in our country.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 31st, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received yours of the 10th instant, and am of opinion
with you, that the English will evaluate New York and
Charleston, as the troops there, after the late resolutions of
Parliament, must be useless, and are necessary to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
their remaining islands, where they have not at present
more than three thousand men. The prudence of this
operation is so obvious, that I think they can hardly miss
it; otherwise, I own, that considering their conduct for
several years past, it is not reasoning consequentially to
conclude they will do a thing, because the doing it is required
by common sense.</p>

<p>Yours of the 26th is just come to hand. I thank you
for the communication of Digges's message. He has also
sent me a long letter, with two from Mr Hartley. I shall
see M. de Vergennes tomorrow, and will acquaint you
with everything material that passes on the subject. But
the Ministry, by whom Digges pretends to be sent, being
changed, we shall, by waiting a little, see what tone will be
taken by their successors. You shall have a copy of the
instructions by the next courier. I congratulate you cordially
on the progress you have made among those slow
people. Slow however as they are, Mr Jay finds his<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
much slower. By an American, who goes in about ten
days to Holland, I shall send you a packet of correspondence
with Mr Hartley, though it amounts to little.</p>

most obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received your favors of March the 11th and
12th, forwarded to me by Mr Digges, and another of the
21st per post. I congratulate you on the returning good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
disposition of your nation towards America, which appears
in the resolutions of Parliament, that you have sent me;
and I hope the change of your Ministry will be attended
with salutary effects. I continue in the same sentiments
expressed in my former letters; but as I am but one of
five in the commission, and have no knowledge of the sentiments
of the others, what has passed between us is to be
considered merely as private conversation. The five persons
are Messrs Adams, Jay, Laurens, Jefferson, and
myself; and in case of the death or absence of any, the
remainder have power to act or conclude. I have not
written to Mr Laurens, having constantly expected him
here, but shall write to him next post; when I shall also
write more fully to you, having now only time to add,
that I am ever, with great esteem and affection, dear Sir,

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,</p>

<p>I wrote a few lines to you the 31st past, and promised
to write more fully. On perusing again your letters of the
11th, 12th, and 21st, I do not find any notice taken of
one from me, dated February the 16th. I therefore now
send you a copy made from it in the press. The uncertainty
of free transmission discourages a free communication
of sentiments on these important affairs; but the inutility
of discussion between persons, one of whom is not
authorised, but in conjunction with others, and the other
not authorised at all, as well as the obvious inconveniences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that may attend such previous handling of points, that are
to be considered, when we come to treat regularly, is
with me a still more effectual discouragement, and determines
me to waive that part of the correspondence.</p>

<p>As to Digges, I have no confidence in him, nor in anything
he says, or may say, of his being sent by Ministers.
Nor will I have any communication with him, except in
receiving and considering the justification of himself, which
he pretends he shall be able and intends to make, for his
excessive drafts on me, on account of the relief I have
ordered to the prisoners, and his embezzlement of the money.</p>

<p>You justly observe in yours of the 12th, that the first
object is to procure a "meeting of qualified and authorised
persons," and that you understand the Ministry will be
ready to proceed towards opening a negotiation as soon as
the bill shall pass, and therefore it is necessary to consult
time and place, and manner and persons, on each side.
This you wrote while the old Ministry existed. If the
new have the same intentions, and desire a general peace,
they may easily discharge Mr Laurens from those engagements,
which make his acting in the commission improper,
and except Mr Jefferson, who remains in America, and is
not expected here, we the Commissioners of Congress can
easily be got together ready to meet yours, at such place
as shall be agreed to by the powers at war, in order to
form the treaty. God grant, that there may be wisdom
enough assembled to make, if possible, a peace that shall
be perpetual, and that the idea of any nations being natural
enemies to each other, may be abolished for the honor of
human nature.</p>

<p>With regard to those who may be commissioned from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
your government, whatever personal preferences I may
conceive in my own mind, it cannot become me to express
them. I only wish for wise and honest men. With such,
a peace may be speedily concluded. With contentious
wranglers the negotiation may be drawn into length, and
finally frustrated.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see in the votes and Parliamentary
speeches, and in your public papers, that in mentioning
America, the word <em>reconciliation</em> is often used. It certainly
means more than a mere peace. It is a sweet expression.
Revolve in your mind, my dear friend, the
means of bringing about this <em>reconciliation</em>. When you
consider the injustice of your war with us, and the barbarous
manner in which it has been carried on, the many
suffering families among us from your burning of towns,
scalping by savages, &amp;c. &amp;c., will it not appear to you,
that though a cessation of the war may be a peace, it may
not be a reconciliation? Will not some voluntary acts of
justice, and even of kindness on your part, have excellent
effects towards producing such a <em>reconciliation</em>? Can
you not find means of repairing in some degree those injuries?
You have in England and Ireland twelve hundred
of our people prisoners, who have for years bravely
suffered all the hardships of that confinement, rather than
enter into your service, to fight against their country.
Methinks you ought to glory in descendants of such virtue.
What if you were to begin your measures of <em>reconciliation</em>
by setting them at liberty? I know it would procure for
you the liberty of an equal number of your people, even
without a previous stipulation; and the confidence in our
equity, with the apparent good will in the action, would
give very good impressions of your change of disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
towards us. Perhaps you have no knowledge of the opinions
lately conceived of your king and country, in America;
the enclosed copy of a letter will make you a little
acquainted with them, and convince you how impossible
must be every project of bringing us again under the dominion
of such a sovereign.</p>

<p>With great esteem, I am, dear Sir, your most obedient
and most humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 8th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Since my last, an extraordinary revolution has taken
place in the Court of England. All the old Ministers are
out, and the chiefs of the opposition are in their places.
The newspapers that I send will give you the names as
correctly as we yet know them. Our last advices mention
their kissing hands, but they had yet done nothing in their
respective offices, by which one might judge of their projected
measures, as whether they will ask a peace, of
which they have great need, the nation having of late suffered
many losses, men grown extremely scarce, and Lord
North's new taxes proposed as funds for the loan meeting
with great opposition; or whether they will strive to find
new resources, and obtain allies to enable them to please
the King and nation by some vigorous exertions against
France, Spain, and Holland.</p>

<p>With regard to America, having while in opposition
carried the vote for making no longer an offensive war with
us, they seem to have tied their own hands from acting
against us. Their predecessors had been tampering with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
this Court for a separate peace. The King's answer gave
me great pleasure. It will be sent to M. de la Luzerne,
and by him communicated to Congress. None of their
attempts to divide us meet with the least encouragement,
and I imagine the present set will try other measures.</p>

<p>My letters from Holland give pleasing accounts of the
rapid progress our affairs are making in that country. The
packet from M. Dumas, which I forward with this, will
give you the particulars. The Prince de Broglie will do
me the favor of delivering this to you. He goes over to
join the French army with the more pleasure, as it is employed
in the cause of liberty, a cause he loves, and in
establishing the interests of America, a country for which
he has much regard and affection. I recommend him
earnestly to the civilities and services it may be in your
power to render him, and I request you would introduce
him to the President of Congress, and to the principal
members civil and military.</p>

<p>Our excellent friend, the Marquis de Lafayette, will sail
in about three weeks. By that time we may have more
interesting intelligence from England, and I shall write you
fully.</p>

if I had not till lately expected you here, as I understood
it to be your intention. Your enlargement gave me great
pleasure, and I hope that the terms exacted by the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>

to make peace with us and our allies at the same

<p>As to our treating separately, and quitting our present
alliance, which the late ministry seemed to desire, it is impossible.
Our treaties and our instructions, as well as the
honor and interest of our country, forbid it. I will communicate

Versailles, April 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have laid before the Count de Vergennes, the different
letters, which Mr Hartley had written to you, as well
as your proposed reply; the Minister has given his entire
approbation to the manner in which you have expressed
yourself. I subjoin a postscript concerning Mr Forth;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
the Count de Vergennes, who has given it a perusal, finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
that you may without impropriety transmit it to your correspondent.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir, with the most sincere attachment,
your very humble and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
DE RAYNEVAL.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> Since my letter was written, Sir, I have considered
anew the different overtures which it embraces.
In your opinion, the late English Minister sincerely desired
a reconciliation with us, and proposed with this view a separate
peace. At the time you were transmitting this
wish of Lord North to me, this exminister employed an
emissary here to sound the Minister of France on the pacific
disposition of his Court, and offer very advantageous
propositions. You will be able to judge from this, Sir, of
the opinion which I ought to have of the intention of Lord
North and his colleagues. To convince you of the truth
of the suggestions which I communicate, I will confide to
you, that the emissary was a Mr Forth, and that he was
charged to reply to the English Minister, "<em>that the King of
France is as desirous of peace as the King of England;
and that he would accede to it as soon as he could with
dignity and safety; but it is a matter of the last importance
for His Most Christian Majesty to know, whether the
Court of London is disposed to treat on equal terms with
the allies of France</em>." Mr Forth has set out for London
with this answer; but it is probable he will not arrive
till after the Ministers, who have sent him, have retired
from office.</p>

<p>You may, Sir, without the least hesitation, make use of
these details if you judge it expedient. They will make
known to the Minister in place the principles of the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
of France, and they will convince him, I hope, that the
project of disuniting us will be as illusory as it will prove
injurious to us. As to the reply sent by Mr Forth, I cannot
foresee (if the new ministers are instructed on this
point) in what manner they will think they ought to consider
it; if they love peace, as they have persuaded the
English nation and all Europe, they need not be embarrassed;
France has opened a way in which they can, in
my opinion, act without wounding the dignity of their master;
if they do not adopt it, they flatter themselves, without
doubt, that the chance of war will procure for England the
success, which heretofore has been denied her; it will be
for Providence to crown or frustrate their hopes.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Being at Court on Tuesday, I learnt from the Dutch
Minister, that the new English Ministry have offered,
through the Ministers of Russia, a cessation of arms to
Holland, and a renewal of the treaty of 1674. M. de
Berkenrode seemed to be of the opinion, that the offer
was intended to gain time, to obstruct the concert of operations
with France for the ensuing campaign, and to prevent
the conclusion of a Treaty with America. It is apprehended,
that it may have some effect in strengthening
the hands of the English party in that country, and retard
affairs a little, but it is hoped, that the proposal will not be
finally agreed to. It would indeed render the Dutch ridiculous.
A, having a cane in his hand, meets his neighbor
B, who happens to have none, takes the advantage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
gives him a sound drubbing. B, having found a stick,
and coming to return the blows he received, A says, my
old friend, why should we quarrel? We are neighbors,
let us be good ones, and live peaceably by each other as
we used to do. If B is so easily satisfied, and lays aside
his stick, the rest of the neighbors, as well as A, will laugh
at him. This is the light in which I stated it. Enclosed
I send you a copy of the proposition.</p>

<p>I see by the newspapers, that the Spaniards, having
taken a little post called St Joseph, pretend to have made
a conquest of the Illinois country. In what light does this
proceeding appear to Congress? While they decline our
offered friendship, are they to be suffered to encroach
on our bounds, and shut us up within the Appalachian
mountains? I begin to fear they have some such project.</p>

<p>Having seen in the English prints an article from Lisbon,
that two American ships, under French colors, being
arrived in that port, were seized by the government, I
asked the Portuguese Ambassador if it was true. He said
he had no advice of it, as he certainly should have had if
such a thing had happened; he therefore did not give the
least credit to it, and said, we might make ourselves perfectly
easy; no such treatment would in his opinion be
offered us in their ports; and he further observed, on the
falsehood of English newspapers, their having lately asserted,
that the Congress had issued letters of marque for
cruising against the Portuguese.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 13th, 1782.</p>


<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Since mine of the 5th, I have thought further of the
subject of our late letters. You were of opinion, that the
late Ministry desired <em>sincerely</em> a reconciliation with America,
and with that view a separate peace with us was proposed.
It happened, that, at the same time, Lord North
had an emissary here to sound the French Ministers with
regard to peace, and to make them very advantageous
propositions, in case they would abandon America. You
may judge from hence, my dear friend, what opinion I
must have formed of the intentions of your Ministers. To
convince you of the truth of this, I may acquaint you, that
the emissary was a Mr Forth; and that the answer given
him to carry back to the English Ministers, was, "<em>that the
King of France is as desirous of peace as the King of
England; and that he would accede to it as soon as he
could with dignity and safety; but it is a matter of the last
importance for His Most Christian Majesty to know,
whether the Court of London is disposed to treat on equal
terms with the allies of France</em>."</p>

<p>Mr Forth went off with this answer for London, but
probably did not arrive till after the dismission of the Ministers
that sent him. You may make any use of this information,
as you judge proper. The new Ministry may
see by it the principles that govern this Court; and it will
convince them, I hope, that the project of dividing us is
as vain as it would be to us injurious. I cannot judge
what they will think or do in consequence of the answer
sent by Mr Forth, if they have seen it. If they love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
peace, as they have persuaded the English nation and all
Europe to believe, they can be under no difficulty.
France has opened a path, which in my opinion they may
use, without hurting the dignity of their master, or the
honor of the nation. If they do not choose it, they doubtless
flatter themselves, that a war may still produce successes
in favor of England, that have hitherto been withheld.
The crowning or frustrating such hopes belongs
to Divine Providence; may God send us all more wisdom!</p>

<p>I am ever, my dear friend, yours most affectionately,</p>

Passy, April 13th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Enclosed with this, I send to your Excellency the packet
of correspondence between Mr Hartley and me, which I
promised in my last. You will see, that we held nearly
the same language; which gives me pleasure.</p>

<p>While Mr Hartley was making propositions to me, with
the approbation or privity of Lord North, to treat separately
from France, that Minister had an emissary here, a
Mr Forth, formerly a Secretary of Lord Stormont's, making
proposals to induce this Court to treat without us. I
understand, that several sacrifices were offered to be made,
and among the rest Canada to be given up to France.
The substance of the answer appears in my last letter to
Mr Hartley. But there is a sentence omitted in that letter,
which I much liked, viz. "<em>that whenever the two
Crowns should come to treat, His Most Christian Majesty</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
<em>would show how much the engagements he might enter into
were to be relied on, by his exact observance of those he
already had with his present allies</em>."</p>

<p>If you have received anything in consequence of your
answer by Digges, you will oblige me by communicating
it. The Ministers here were much pleased with the account
given them of your interview by the Ambassador.</p>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p>The Court of Denmark has been informed, that the
ship Providence of Christiana in Norway, destined from
London for St Thomas, a Danish Island, with a cargo of
divers merchandise, has been stopped in the latitude of
Antigua, by an American privateer called the Henry,
Captain Thomas Benson, and has been conducted into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
port of New England, under the pretence, that the cargo
might be English property.</p>

<p>As this act is prejudicial to the credit, security, and liberty
of the Danish flag, the underwritten has been charged,
by order of his Court, to communicate the same to his
Excellency the Count de Vergennes, requesting, that he
will be pleased to effect, by his intervention, a prompt and
entire restitution of the said vessel and cargo, with damages
proportioned to the unjust detention; and that he will
be kind enough at the same time to endeavor to obtain,
that precise orders be given to the American privateers
not to trouble in anywise the navigation and commerce of
Denmark, but to respect its flag.</p>

<p>The Court has the greater right to expect this compliance
on the part of the Americans, as they continue to
enjoy every liberty, and to find every assistance in its
American islands, and they will always experience the
same kind treatment on the part of Denmark, provided
they correspond by proceedings equally amicable.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, May 1st, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I have received a packet from you containing several
letters of various dates. As I shall probably have a safe
opportunity of conveyance to you when Mr Laurens leaves
this country, I am now sitting down to write to you an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnium</i> kind of letter of various matters as they occur.
The late Ministry being departed, I may now speak of
things more freely. I will take a sentence in one of your
letters for my text. Vide yours of April 13th, 1782, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
which you say, <em>you were of opinion that the late Ministry
desired</em> <small>SINCERELY</small> <em>a reconciliation with America, and with
that view a separate peace</em> with us was proposed. I
must qualify this sentence much before I can adopt it as
my opinion. As to <em>reconciliation</em>, I never gave much
credit to them for that wish. <em>It is a sweet expression. It
certainly means</em> <small>MORE</small> <em>than peace.</em> The utmost I ever
gave the late Ministry credit for, was a wish for peace.
And I still believe, that the wisest among them grew from
day to day more disposed to peace, or an abatement of
the war, in proportion as they became more alarmed for
their own situations and their responsibility. Had the war
been more successful, I should not have expected much
relenting towards peace or reconciliation. That this has
always been the measure of my opinion of them, I refer
you to some words in a letter from me to you, dated January
5th, 1780, for proof&mdash;"but for the point of sincerity;
why, as to that, I have not much to say; I have at least
expected some hold upon their <em>prudence</em>."</p>

<p>My argument runs thus, it is a <em>bargain</em> for <em>you</em> (Ministers)
to be sincere <em>now</em>. Common prudence may hint to
you to look to yourselves. It has amazed me beyond
measure, that this principle of common selfish <em>prudence</em>
has not had the effect which I expected. I have not
been disposed to be deceived by any conciliatory professions,
which I considered only as arising from prudence,
and I hope that I have not led you into any deception,
having so fully explained myself to you on that head.
Had the American war been more prosperous on the part
of the late Ministry, I do not believe the late resignation
would have taken place. But it is evident, from the
proposition to the Court of France, which you have communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
to me, (and which I have communicated to the
present Ministry your letter) that even to the last
hour some part of the late Ministry were still set upon the
American war to the last extremity; and probably another
more <em>prudent</em> part of the Ministry would proceed no further;
which, if it be so, may reasonably be imputed as the
cause of the dissolution of the late Ministry.</p>

<p>These have been the arguments, which I have always
driven and insisted upon with the greatest expectation
of success, viz. <em>prudential</em> arguments from the total impracticability
of the war, responsibility, &amp;c. I have been
astonished beyond measure, that these arguments have not
sooner had their effect. If I could give you an idea of
the many conferences, which I have had upon the subject,
I should tell you, that many times <em>Felix has trembled</em>.
When reduced by the terror of responsibility either to renounce
the American war, or to relinquish their places,
they have chosen the latter; which is a most wretched
and contemptible retribution either to their country or to
mankind, for the desolation in which they have involved
every nation, that they have ever been connected with.
Peace they would not leave behind them. Their legacy
to their country, and to mankind has been, <em>let darkness
be the burier of the dead</em>!</p>

<p>As to the proposal of a separate peace arising from a
desire of <em>reconciliation</em>, it certainly was so on the part of
the people of England, but on the part of the late Ministry,
it probably arose from the hopes of suggesting to France
ideas of some infidelity on the part of America towards
them. If you should ask me, why I have <em>seemed</em> to conspire
with this, my answer is very plain. In the first
place, if I could have prevailed with the late Ministry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
have actually made an irrevocable offer, <em>on their own
part</em>, of a separate peace to America, that very offer
would in the same instant have become on their part also
a consent to a general peace; because <em>they</em> never had any
wish to a separate contest with France, and America being
out of the question, <em>they</em> would have thought of nothing
after that but a general peace. I never could bring them
even to this. <em>They</em> wished that <em>America</em> should make the
offer of a separate treaty, for obvious views. <em>My</em> proposal
was, that <em>they</em> should offer irrevocable terms of peace
to America. If they had meant what they pretended, and
what the people of England did really desire, they would
have adopted that proposition. Then the question would
have come forward upon the fair and honorable construction
of a treaty between France and America, <em>the essential and
direct end</em> of which was fully accomplished. When I
speak of Great Britain offering irrevocable terms of peace
to America, I mean such terms as would have effectually
satisfied the provision of the treaty, viz. tacit independence.</p>

<p>I send you a paper entitled a <cite>Breviate</cite>, which I laid
before the late Ministry, and their not having acted upon
it, was a proof to me that the disposition of their heart to
America was not altered, but that all their relenting arose
from the impracticability of that war, and their want of success
in it. But desponding as they were at last, it was not
inconsistent with my expectations of their conduct, that they
should make great offers to France to abandon America.
It was the only weapon left in their hands. In course of
negotiating with the late Ministry, I perceived their courage
drooping from time to time, for the last three or four
years, and it was upon that ground I gave them credit for
an increasing disposition towards peace. Some dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
off, others sunk under the load of folly, and at last they
all failed. My argument <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad homines</i> to the late Ministry
might be stated thus. <em>If you don't kill them, they will kill
you.</em> But the war is impracticable <em>on your part</em>; ergo,
the best thing you can do <em>for your own sake</em> is to make
<em>peace</em>. This was reasoning to men, and through men to
things. But there is no measure of rage in pride and disappointment,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i6">Spicula c&oelig;ca relinquunt</span>
<span class="i0">Infixa venis, animasque in vulnere ponunt.</span>
</div>

<p>So much for the argument of the <em>breviate</em>, as far as it
respected the late Ministry. It was a test which proved
that they were not sincere in their professions. If they
had been in earnest, to have given the war a turn towards
the House of Bourbon, and to have dropped the American
war, a plain road lay before them. The sentiments
of the people of England were conformable to the argument
of that breviate; or rather I should say, what is the
real truth, that the arguments of the breviate were dictated
by the notoriety of that sentiment in the people of
England. My object and wish always has been to strike
at the root of the evil, the American war.</p>

<p>If the British nation have jealousies and resentments
against the House of Bourbon, yet still the first step in
every case would be to rescind the American war, and
not to keep it lurking in the rear, to become hereafter,
in case of certain events, a reversionary war with America
for unconditional terms. This reversionary war was
never the object of the people of England; therefore
the argument of the breviate was calculated bona fide to
accomplish their views, and to discriminate the fallacious
pretences of the late administration from the real wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of the country, as expressed in the circular resolution of
many counties in the year 1780, first moved at York,
on March 28th, 1780. Every other principle and every
mode of conduct only imply, as you very justly express
it, a secret hope that war may still produce successes, and
then&mdash;. The designs which have been lurking under this
pretext could not mean anything else than this. Who
knows but that we may still talk to America at last. The
only test of clear intentions would have been this, to have
cut up the American war, and all possible return to it for
any cause, or under any pretext. I am confident that the
sentiment of the people of England is, and always has
been, to procure peace and reconciliation with America,
and to vindicate the national honor in the contest with the
House of Bourbon. If this intention had been pursued in
a simple and direct manner, I am confident that the honor
and safety of the British nation would long ago have been
established in a general peace with all the belligerent
powers. These are the sentiments upon which I have
always acted in those negotiations, which I have had upon
the subject of peace with the late Ministry; reconciliation
with America, and peace with all the world, upon terms
consistent with the honor and safety of my own country.</p>

<p>Peace must be sought in such ways, as promise the
greatest degree of practicability. The sentiments of individuals
as philanthropists may be overborne by the power
of ancient prejudices, which too frequently prevail in the aggregates
of nations. In such case, the philanthropist, who
wishes the good of his own country and of mankind, must
be the bulrush bending to the storm, and not the sturdy
oak, unavailingly resisting. National prejudices are, I
hope, generally upon the decline. Reason and humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
gain ground every day against their <em>natural</em> enemies, folly
and injustice. The ideas of nations being <em>natural</em> enemies
to each other are generally reprobated. But still
<em>jealousies</em> and ancient rivalships remain, which obstruct the
road to peace among men. If one belligerent nation will
entertain a standing force of three or four hundred thousand
fighting men, other nations must have defended frontiers
and barrier towns, and the barrier of a neighboring
island, whose constitution does not allow a standing military
force, must consist in a superiority at sea. It is necessary
for her own defence. If all nations by mutual consent
will reduce their <em>offensive</em> powers, which they only claim
under the pretext of necessary <em>defence</em>, and bring forward
the reign of the millennium; then away with your frontiers
and barriers, and your Gibraltars, and the key of the
Baltic, and all the hostile array of nations,</p>

<p class="center">
Aspera compositis nitescant sæcula bellis.
</p>

<p>These must be the sentiments of every philanthropist in his
interior thoughts. But if we are not to seek peace by
some practicable method, accommodated to the remaining
prejudices of the multitude, we shall not in our own time,
I fear, see that happy day. If Great Britain and France
are ancient rivals, then, until the reign of the millennium
shall approach, arrange that rivalship upon equitable terms,
as the two leading nations of Europe, set them in balance
to each other; the one by land, the other by sea. Give
to France her elevated rank among the nations of Europe.
Give to Great Britain the honor of her flag, and the security
of her island by her wooden walls, and there would be
no obstruction to general and perpetual peace. The prejudices
of disrespect between nations prevail only among the
inferior ranks. Believe me, for one at least, I have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
highest sentiments of respect for the nation of France. I
have no other sentiments of hostility but what are honorable
towards them, and which, as a member of a rival
State at war with them, consists in the duty of vigilance
which I owe towards the honor and interests of my own
country. I am not conscious of a word or a thought,
which on <em>the point of honor</em> I would wish to have concealed
from a French Minister.</p>

<p>In the mode which I have proposed of unraveling the
present subjects of jealousy and contest, I would make my
proposals openly to France herself. Let America be free,
and enjoy happiness and peace forever. If France and
Great Britain have jealousies or rivalships between themselves,
as European nations, I then say to France, let us
settle these points between ourselves, if unfortunately we
shall not be able by honorable negotiation to compromise the
indispensable points of national honor and safety. This
would be my language to France, open and undisguised.
In the meanwhile I desire you to observe, that it would
not be with reluctance that I should offer eternal freedom,
happiness, and peace to America. You know my thoughts
too well to suspect that. I speak only as in a state of war,
desirous to arrange the complicated interests, and to secure
the respective honor of nations. My wishes are, and always
have been for the peace, liberty, and safety of mankind.
In the pursuit of those blessed objects, not only this
country and America, but France herself and the House
of Bourbon, may justly claim the conspiring exertions of
every free and liberal mind, even among their temporary
enemies and rivals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Breviate mentioned in the preceding Letter.</em></p>

<p><em>February 7th, 1782.</em>&mdash;It is stated, that America is disposed
to enter into a negotiation of peace with Great
Britain, without requiring any formal recognition of independence;
always understood, that they are to act in conjunction
with their allies, conformable to treaties.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended to give for reply, that the
Ministers of Great Britain are likewise disposed to enter
into a negotiation for peace, and that they are ready to
open a general treaty for that purpose.</p>

<p>If the British Ministers should see any objection to a
general treaty, but should still be disposed to enter into a
separate treaty with America, it is then recommended to
them to offer such terms to America as shall induce her to
apply to her allies for their consent, that she should be permitted
to enter into a separate treaty with Great Britain.
The condition of which being the consent of allies, no
proposition of any breach of faith can be understood to be
required by them, by the requisition of a separate treaty.</p>

<p>The British Ministers are free to make any propositions
to America, which they may think proper, provided they
be not dishonorable in themselves, which in the present
case is barred by the supposition of consent being obtained.
In this case, therefore, if they should be inclined
to offer a separate treaty, it is recommended to them to
offer such terms to America, as should induce her to be
desirous of closing with the proposal of a separate treaty,
on the grounds of national security and interests, and likewise
such as may constitute to them a case of reason and
justice, upon which they may make requisition to their allies
for their consent. It is suggested, that the offer to America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of a truce of sufficient length, together with the removal of
the British troops, would be equivalent to that case, which
is provided for in the treaty of February 6th, 1778, between
America and France, viz. <em>tacit</em> independence; and
the declared ends of that alliance being accomplished, it
would not be reasonable that America should be dragged
on by their allies in a war, the continuance of which,
between France and Great Britain, could only be caused
by separate European jealousies and resentments (if unfortunately
for the public peace any such should arise)
between themselves, independent and unconnected with
the American cause. It is to be presumed, that France
would not in point of honor to her allies refuse her consent
so requested, as any rivalship or punctilios between
her and Great Britain, as European nations, (principles
which too frequently disturb the peace of mankind) could
not be considered as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus f&oelig;deris</i> of the American alliance;
and their pride as a belligerent power would not
permit them to claim the assistance of America as necessary
to their support, thereby proclaiming their nation
unequal to the contest in case of the continuance of a war
with Great Britain, after the settlement and pacification with
America. Their consent, therefore, is to be presumed.
But if they should demur on this point, if Great Britain
should be disposed to concede <em>tacit</em> independence to
America by a long truce, and the removal of the troops, and
if the obstruction should evidently occur on the part of
France, under any equivocal or captious construction of a
<em>defensive</em> treaty of alliance between America and France,
Great Britain would from thenceforward stand upon advantage
ground, either in any negotiation with America, or
in the continuance of a war including America, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
arising from any further resentments of Great Britain
towards America, but imposed reluctantly upon both
parties by the conduct of the Court of France.</p>

<p>These thoughts are not suggested with any view of giving
any preference in favor of a separate treaty above a
general treaty, or above any plans of separate but concomitant
treaties, like the treaties of Munster and Osnaburgh,
but only to draw out the line of negotiating a separate
treaty, in case the British Ministry should think it necessary
to adhere to that mode. But in all cases it should
seem indispensable to express some disposition, on the part
of Great Britain, to adopt either one mode or the other.
An absolute refusal to treat at all must necessarily drive
America into the closest connexion with France, and all
other foreign hostile powers, who would take that advantage
for making every possible stipulation to the future
disadvantage of British interests, and above all things
would probably stipulate, that America should never make
peace with Great Britain, without the most formal and explicit
recognition of their independence, absolute and unlimited.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, May 22d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I expected to have written you a long letter, more particularly
as it is some time since you have received any
information from this country, the enemy having effectually
blocked up our ports for some months past. But I find
myself so extremely hurried, that I have hardly leisure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
write this, the vessel by which it is to be sent going sooner
than I apprehended.</p>

<p>You will receive herewith a letter to His Most Christian
Majesty, which you will present, and a copy, which you
will be pleased to deliver to the Count de Vergennes.
This I believe is the usual form. You will also receive in
the enclosed papers an account of the marks of respect,
with which the annunciation of the birth of the Dauphin
was received. These are of some importance, at a time
when Great Britain is endeavoring to represent us as weary
of the alliance, and anxiously wishing to return to our
connexion with them. It is probable, that the late changes
in the British Administration, and the conciliatory measures
they propose, may excite apprehensions of our firmness.
I have the pleasure of assuring you, that it has not
produced the least effect; all orders of people seem to
agree, that it should redouble our vigilance, and while it
argues the weakness of the enemy, it serves as a spring to
our exertions.</p>

<p>Sir Guy Carleton, shortly after his arrival, wrote a complimentary
letter to General Washington, sending him an
account of his appointment, and the prints which contained
the Parliamentary debates, and requesting leave to send
his Secretary with despatches to Congress. The General
refused the passport, till he had the sense of Congress
thereon; and upon Sir Guy's letter being laid before them,
they came to the resolution enclosed.</p>

<p>The papers I send you contain also resolutions of the
State of Maryland, and of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania,
which I believe speak the language of all the
States, which will, I doubt not, make similar declarations
when their legislatures shall be convened. So that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
may safely assure His Majesty's Ministers, that no art which
Great Britain can put in practice will have the least influence
in lessening the attachment of the people of this country
to the principles of the alliance. It is true their
expectations of powerful assistance this campaign are very
high. They saw with some pain last year, that the fleet
was withdrawn when the enemy were absolutely at their
feet, and when one month's stay would have reduced either
New York or Charleston. They look eagerly for the
return of the fleet. They generally believe this to be the
last campaign in America. There is no knowing what effect
a disappointment in this hope would have. I believe,
from the present view of things, that they would bear it
with fortitude, but I should be sorry to see it put to the trial.</p>

<p>Our trade has suffered astonishingly of late; the influence
which this will have upon our internal resources is
much to be apprehended. It is to be wished, that France
would see the great advantages she would derive from
keeping a superiority on this coast, where her fleets would
be maintained cheaply while they protected our commerce,
and compelled England either to risk her army, or to keep
a regular fleet here at five times their expense. Enclosed is
a statement of our trade drawn up by Mr Morris. You are
requested to communicate this to the Court of Versailles,
and to use every means in your power to bring the Court
to concur in adopting it.</p>

<p>I also enclose a resolution of Congress, to request you
to apply for the prisoners due to us, in order that they may
be sent here and exchanged for our seamen, who are confined
without the hope of relief. Is it impossible to devise
some means for the enlargement of those, who are confined
in England? Can no cartel be settled? Or no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
devised for sending them here to be exchanged? Their
case is really pitiable.</p>

<p class="close">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, May 25th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>Yours of the 13th instant I received by Mr Oswald. I
did not doubt but that the news of a general and absolute
release of the American prisoners, which Lord Shelburne
was so good as to communicate to me, in answer to that
part of your letter of the 5th of April, in which you speak
so pathetically of <em>sweet reconciliation</em>, would give you much
sincere and heartfelt pleasure. God send that it may be
the happy omen of final <em>reconciliation</em> and <em>durable peace</em>.
I should be very happy to hear that good news from you,
and in any way to contribute to it. Having on that subject
communicated the preliminaries, dated May, 1782, to
Lord Shelburne, you may be assured that I have no reservations
upon that head respecting America, in any circumstances
or condition whatever. You know all my
thoughts upon that subject, and the principles upon which
they are founded, and therefore that they are not changeable.</p>

<p>It would give me the greatest pleasure, if I could hope
for any opportunity of seeing you. I could say many
things, which are otherwise incommunicable, and which
perhaps would contribute to facilitate the road to peace.
I think I see in many parts much matter to work with, out
of which a peace, honorable to all parties and upon durable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
principles, might be established. <em>No degrading or
mortifying conditions to shorten peace and rekindle war.</em>
Perhaps I might not say too much if I were to add, that
simply the adoption of <em>reason</em> among nations, and the mere
rectification of obsolete and gothic absurdities, which carry
no gratification, would afford a fund of remuneration to all
parties for renouncing those objects of mutual contention,
which, <em>in the eye of reason</em>, are no better than creatures of
passion, jealousy, and false pride. Until the principles of
<em>reason</em> and equity shall be adopted in national transactions,
peace will not be durable amongst men.</p>

<p>These are reflections general to all nations. As to the
mutual concerns between Great Britain and North America,
<em>reconciliation</em> is the touchstone to prove those hearts,
which are without alloy. If I can be of any assistance to
you, in any communications or explanations conducive to
peace, you may command my utmost services. Even if
a French Minister were to overhear such an offer, let him
not take it in jealous part. Zealously and affectionately
attached to my own country and to America, I am nevertheless
most perfectly of accord with you, that justice and
honor should be observed towards all nations. Mr Oswald
will do me the favor to convey this to you. I heartily wish
him success in his pacific embassy.</p>

<p>Yours ever most affectionately,</p>

DAVID HARTLEY.

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, May 30th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Since my last of the 22d instant, I have been honored
with yours of the 30th of March, together with the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
from Mr Adams to you enclosed, and the papers, for
which I am extremely obliged to you.</p>

<p>I am not at all disappointed at the manner in which
the British administration have declared their wish for
peace, or at the reluctance they show in parting with this
country. To a proud nation the loss of 3,000,000 subjects
is mortifying. Every journeyman weaver in every petty
village in England conceived himself a sovereign, even
while working for the slaves of his supposed subjects.
It requires a degree of magnanimity, of which they are
incapable, to surrender with dignity what they are no longer
able to hold. But they must suppose the politics of the
rest of the world to move upon weaker principles than
their own, if they imagine the offers they propose to hold
out to the belligerent powers will detach them from their
alliance with each other, till all the objects of it are
attained. Of what avail would the cessions they made in
the West Indies be to France, if we were again connected
with England. What security would she have for those
cessions, or even for the rest of her islands? What she has
offered to Spain I know not. To us she has offered nothing,
as I have yet heard, but her friendship and the blessings
of her government. A seven years' enmity has
taught us to put very little value on the former; and the
present happiness of the people of England and Ireland
has enabled us to form a just estimate of the latter.</p>

<p>I have told you, that we have nothing to apprehend here
from the offers of Britain. I have had no reason since to
change that opinion. The way, however, to put it out of
doubt is to enable us to expel the enemy from this continent.
The task is not difficult, and the object is sufficiently
important not to let it depend upon other operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>I am instructed to prepare a memorial to the Court of
Versailles, on the subject of the prize money due to Paul
Jones, and the officers and men that sailed under his command.
Continual complaints are made on that subject.
Surely M. de Chaumont has had sufficient time to settle
this business. I must beg the favor of you to press it, and
to draw and present a memorial to the Court, if it cannot
otherwise be accomplished. Mr Barclay will have
orders to receive the money for them. I enclose an exstract
of a letter from Captain Jones on the subject,
together with the list of the ships and their force, agreeable
to which the division should be made.</p>

<p>I also send his account of the detention of the brigantine
Berkenbosch, together with a copy of De Nief's certificate,
that the property belonged to British owners. This I
think at first view is a sufficient justification of his conduct,
and I hope will be deemed satisfactory, especially when it
is considered that our courts are open for a further prosecution
of the inquiry, if any injury has been unjustly sustained.
I shall take the earliest opportunity to inquire into
the other cases you mention. If I am rightly informed,
the insult to the Court of Norway is already avenged, the
vessels, which are said to have committed it, having been
lost at sea. This puts a stop to any further inquiry about
it. I shall however endeavor to get this fact more fully
ascertained, and write to you again. I should be glad to
know on what principle these applications are made to the
Court of France. If the powers, who suppose themselves
injured, consider us as the subjects of Great Britain, they
should carry their complaints to the Court of St James's.
If they consider us as independent of them, they should
address themselves to us or to you directly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>I am very happy to find you have not lost sight of the
prizes detained by the Danish Court, and that you so happily
availed yourself of the opportunity they afforded you,
to renew your application. This object ought to be pushed,
not so much on account of the value of the vessels, as to
show that we know what is due to <em>ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>Enclosed is a resolution of Congress on the subject of
accounts, which you will be pleased to take the earliest
opportunity to carry into execution.</p>

<p>You draw an agreeable picture of the French Court,
and their favorable dispositions. They stand very high in
the esteem of this country; and though we sometimes entertain
the hope of repaying by our commerce and alliance
the friendship they have shown us, we are not on that
account the less sensible of our obligation to them. The
distrust and jealousies, which secret enemies have endeavored
to excite, have died away. One successful exertion
in our favor will secure to them forever the affections
of this country. I take an interest in the happiness of the
Marquis de Lafayette, which makes me learn with great
pleasure the reception he has met with. No man is more
worthy of the esteem he enjoys, both at home and here.
I have forborne to write to him for some time, in expectation
that he was on his way. The same reasons restrain
me now. Should any extraordinary event have detained
him, you will be so obliging as to mention this as my
apology. I am charmed with your idea of a medal to perpetuate
the memory of York and Saratoga. The thought
is simple, elegant, and strikingly expressive of the subject.
I cannot however but flatter myself, that before it can be
executed, your Hercules will have tasked your invention
for a new emblem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>I enclose a number of letters, that have passed between
Generals Washington, Clinton, Robinson, and Sir Guy,
chiefly on the subject of Captain Huddy, who, having been
taken prisoner and confined some time at New York, was
carried by a Captain Lippincott and a party of soldiers to
the Jersey shore, and there hanged without the least pretence.
You will see an account of the whole transaction
in some of the papers I sent. The General, in pursuance of
his determination, has ordered the lot to be cast among the
British Captains. It has fallen upon the Honorable Captain
Asgill of the Guards, who is now on his way to camp.
A friend of his, Captain Ludlow, is gone to New York to
see if anything can be done to save him. It is really a
melancholy case, but the repeated cruelties of this kind,
that have been practised, have rendered it absolutely necessary
to execute the resolution to retaliate, which we have
so often taken, and so frequently been prevented, by our
feelings, from carrying into execution.</p>

<p>We are yet totally ignorant of the event of the battle
fought on the 12th of April, in the West Indies, of which
you will see various and contradictory accounts in our
papers. You will have more certain information in Europe.
Providence is taken by the Spaniards. Gillon commanded
the fleet on the occasion. He yesterday came to
this port with a number of the Havana vessels, for which
we were in great pain.</p>

<h3>RICHARD OSWALD TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Paris, June 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>While Mr Laurens was under confinement in England,
he promised, that on condition of his being liberated upon
his parole, he would apply to you for an exchange in favor
of Lord Cornwallis, by a discharge of his Lordship
granted upon the surrender of his garrison at the village of
York in Virginia; and, in case of your being under any
difficulty in making such exchange, he undertook to write
to the Congress, and to request it of that assembly, making
no doubt of obtaining a favorable answer, without loss
of time.</p>

<p>This proposal, signed by Mr Laurens's hand, I carried
and delivered, I think, in the month of December last, to
his Majesty's then Secretaries of State, which was duly
attended to; and in consequence thereof Mr Laurens was
soon after set at full liberty. And though not a prisoner
under parole, yet it is to be hoped, a variation in the mode
of discharge will not be supposed of any essential difference.</p>

<p>And with respect to Mr Laurens, I am satisfied he will
consider himself as much interested in the success of this
application, as if his own discharge had been obtained
under the form, as proposed by the representation, which I
delivered to the Secretaries of State, and, I make no
doubt, will sincerely join my Lord Cornwallis in an acknowledgment
of your favor and good offices, in granting
his Lordship a full discharge of his parole abovementioned.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your
most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
RICHARD OSWALD.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span><em>P. S.</em> Major Ross has got no copy of Lord Cornwallis's
parole. He says it was in the common form, as in like cases.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I recollect I was under a mistake,
as if the proposal of exchange came first from Mr
Laurens; whereas, it was made by his Majesty's Secretaries
of State to me, that Mr Laurens should endeavor to
procure the exchange of Lord Cornwallis, so as to be discharged
himself. Which proposal I carried to Mr Laurens,
and had from him the obligation abovementioned,
upon which the mode of his discharge was settled.</p>

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter you did me the honor of writing to
me, respecting the parole of Lord Cornwallis. You are
acquainted with what I wrote some time since to Mr Laurens.
Tomorrow is post day from Holland, when possibly
I may receive an answer, with a paper drawn up by him
for the purpose of discharging that parole, to be signed by
us jointly. I suppose the staying at Paris another day will
not be very inconvenient to Major Ross, and if I do not
hear tomorrow from Mr Laurens, I will immediately, in
compliance with your request, do what I can towards the
liberation of Lord Cornwallis.</p>

<h3>JOHN ADAMS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
The Hague, June 13th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I had yesterday, at Amsterdam, the honor of receiving
your Excellency's letter of June the 2d.</p>

<p>The discovery, that Mr Grenville's power was only to
treat with France, does not surprise me at all. The British
Ministry are too divided among themselves, and have
too formidable an opposition against them, in the King and
the old Ministers, and are possessed of too little of the
confidence of the nation, to have courage to make concessions
of any sort, especially since the news of their successes
in the East and West Indies. What their vanity
will end in God only knows; for my own part, I cannot
see a probability, that they will ever make peace, until
their finances are ruined, and such distresses brought upon
them, as will work up their parties into a civil war.</p>

<p>I wish their enemies could by any means be persuaded
to carry on the war against them in places, where they
might be sure of triumphs, instead of insisting on pursuing
it where they are sure of defeat. But we must take patience,
and wait for time to do what wisdom might easily
and soon do.</p>

<p>I have not as yet taken any engagements with the Dutch
not to make peace without them; but I will take such engagements
in a moment, if the Dutch will take them, and
I believe they would very cheerfully. I shall not propose
it, however, till I have the concurrence of the Duc de la
Vauguyon, who will do nothing without the instructions of
his Court. I would not delay it a moment from any expectation,
that the English will acknowledge our independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
and make peace with us, because I have no such
expectations. The permanent friendship of the Dutch may
be easily obtained by the United States; that of England,
never; it is gone with the days before the flood. If we
ever enjoy the smallest degree of sincere friendship again
from England, I am totally incapable of seeing the character
of a nation or the connexion of things; which however
may be the case for what I know. They have brought
themselves into such a situation! Spain, Holland, America,
the armed neutrality, have all such pretensions and
demands upon them, that where is the English Minister,
or Member of Parliament, that dares vote for the concession
to them? The pretensions of France I believe
would be so moderate, that possibly they might be acceded
to. But it is much to be feared, that Spain, who deserves
the least, will demand the most; in short, the work
of peace appears so impracticable and chimerical, that I
am happy in being restrained to this country, by my duty,
and by this means excused from troubling my head much
about it.</p>

<p>I have a letter from America, that informed me, that Mr
Jay had refused to act in the commission for peace; but if
he is on the way to Paris, as you suppose, I presume my
information must be a mistake, which I am very glad of. Mr
Laurens did me the honor of a very short visit, in his way
to France, but I was very sorry to learn from him, that in
a letter to your Excellency from Ostend, he had declined
serving in the commission for peace. I had vast pleasure
in his conversation, for I found him possessed of the most
exact judgment concerning our enemies, and of the same
noble sentiments in all things, which I saw in him in
Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>What is the system of Russia? Does she suppose, that
England has too many enemies upon her, and that their
demands and pretensions are too high? Does she seek to
embroil affairs, and to light up a general war in Europe?
Is Denmark in concert with her, or any other power?
Her conduct is a phenomenon. Is there any secret negotiation
or intrigue on foot to form a party for England
among the powers of Europe, and to make a balance
against the power of the enemies of England?</p>

<p>The States of Holland and several other provinces have
taken a resolution against the mediation for a separate
peace; and this nation seems to be well fixed in its system,
and in the common cause.</p>

<p>My best respects and affections to my old friend, Mr
Jay, if you please. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most
obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, June 23d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>This will be sent with duplicates of some of my former
letters to the southward, to embrace the first opportunity,
that shall offer from thence. By so uncertain a conveyance
you can expect nothing. Nor indeed does our
present situation furnish anything, that calls for your immediate
attention, unless it be the unanimity with which
the people of all ranks agree in determining to listen to no
proposals from England, which have not the alliance
with France for their basis. Perhaps the joy they have
discovered, in celebrating the birth of the Dauphin, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
considered as a proof of their sincere attachment to the
present illustrious monarch of France and his family.</p>

<p>Leslie has endeavored to bring General Greene to agree
to a suspension of arms for the Southern Department,
which he has very prudently refused.</p>

<p>Nothing has yet been determined, or rather executed,
with respect to Captain Asgill. The enemy are holding a
Court Martial on Lippincott, the executioner of Captain
Huddy; on their decision the life of Captain Asgill will
depend. Such is the melancholy necessity, which the
cruelty of the enemy has imposed.</p>

<p>You enclosed a letter from the Count de Vergennes, on
the subject of the pension due M. Tousard. Congress
are too sensible of that gentleman's merit to deprive him
of it. But as it is necessary, that everything of this kind
be transacted at one office, it is proper that he direct some
person as his agent to apply to the Treasury office here,
and produce your certificate of the time to which the last
payment was made, or at least transmit a statement of his
account, on which the balance will be paid, and his pension
regularly settled with his attorney in future.</p>

<p>The case of the brigantine Ernten has been decided
upon in the inferior courts, and in the Court of Appeals.
The latter have been prevailed upon at my request to give
a rehearing, which is not yet determined. Should its
determination be against the vessel or cargo, on a conviction,
that she was British property, Congress will not
choose to interfere in the execution of the sentence, which
the court they have instituted is competent to award.</p>

<p>I could wish to know from you what allowance you
make to your private Secretary, and to have an accurate
estimate of those contingent expenses of your office, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
you think ought to be charged as distinct from your
salary.</p>

<p>I enclose a copy of a letter from Mr Deane to Governor
Trumbull, with his answer, which you will please to
forward. A copy of the answer is also enclosed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 25th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received your respective letters of January 26th
and February 13th. The first was accompanied with a
form of a convention for the establishment of consuls.
Mr Barclay having been detained these six months in Holland,
though in continual expectation of returning hither, I
have yet done nothing in that business, thinking his presence
might be of use in settling it. As soon as he arrives
I shall move the completion of it.</p>

<p>The second enforces some resolutions of Congress, sent
me with it, respecting a loan of 12,000,000 of livres, to be
demanded of France for the current year. I had already
received the promise of six millions, together with the
clearest and most positive assurances, that it was all the
King could spare to us, that we must not expect more,
that if drafts and demands came upon me beyond that sum,
it behoved me to take care how I accepted them, or where
I should find funds for the payment, since I could certainly
not be further assisted out of the royal treasury. Under
this declaration, with what face could I ask for another six
millions? It would be saying, you are not to be believed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
you can spare more; you are able to lend me twice the
sum if you were but willing. If you read my letter to Mr
Morris of this date, I think you will be convinced how improper
any language, capable of such a construction, would
be to such a friend. I hope, however, that the loan Mr
Adams has opened in Holland for three millions of florins,
which it is said is likely to succeed, will supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>By the newspapers I have sent you will see, that the
general disposition of the British nation towards us had
been changed. Two persons have been sent here by the
new ministers, to propose treating for peace. They had
at first some hopes of getting the belligerent powers to
treat separately, one after another, but finding that impracticable,
they have, after several messengers sent to and
fro, come to a resolution of treating with all together for
a general peace, and have agreed, that the place shall be
Paris. Mr Grenville is now here with full powers for that
purpose, (if they can be reckoned full with regard to America,
till a certain act is completed for enabling his Majesty to
treat, &amp;c., which has gone through the Commons, and has
been once read in the House of Lords.) I keep a very particular
journal of what passes every day in the affair, which
is transcribing to be sent to you. I shall, therefore, need
to say no more about it in this letter, except, that though
I still think they were sincere at first in their desire of peace,
yet since their success in the West Indies, I imagine, that I
see marks of their desiring rather to draw the negotiations
into length, that they may take the chance of what the
campaign shall produce in their favor, and as there are so
many interests to adjust, if will be prudent for us to suppose,
that even another campaign may pass before all can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
be agreed. Something too may happen to break off the
negotiations, and we should be prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>I hoped for the assistance of Mr Adams and Mr Laurens.
The first is too much engaged in Holland to come
hither, and the other declines serving; but I have now the
satisfaction of being joined by Mr Jay, who happily arrived
here from Madrid last Sunday. The Marquis de Lafayette
is of great use in our affairs here, and as the campaign is
not likely to be very active in North America, I wish I
may be able to prevail with him to stay a few weeks longer.
By him you will receive the journal abovementioned,
which is already pretty voluminous, and yet the negotiations
cannot be said to be opened.</p>

<p>Ireland you will see has obtained all her demands triumphantly.
I meet no one from that country, who does
not express some obligations to America for their success.</p>

<p>Before I received your just observations on the subject,
I had obtained from the English Ministers a resolution to
exchange all our prisoners. They thought themselves
obliged to have an act of Parliament about it for authorising
the King to do it, this war being different from others, as
made by an act of Parliament declaring us rebels, and our
people being committed for high treason. I empowered
Mr Hodgson, who was chairman of the committee, that
collected and dispensed the charitable subscriptions for
the American prisoners, to treat and conclude on the terms
of their discharge, and having approved of the draft he sent
me of the agreement, I hope Congress will see fit to order
a punctual execution of it. I have long suffered with those
poor brave men, who with so much public virtue have
endured four or five years hard imprisonment, rather than
serve against their country. I have done all I could afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
towards making their situation more comfortable; but their
numbers were so great, that I could do but little for each,
and that very great villain, Digges, defrauded them of between
three and four hundred pounds, which he drew from
me on their account. He lately wrote me a letter, in which
he pretended he was coming to settle with me, and to
convince me, that I had been mistaken with regard to his
conduct; but he never appeared, and I hear he is gone to
America. Beware of him, for he is very artful, and has
cheated many. I hear every day of new rogueries committed
by him in England.</p>

<p>The Ambassador from Sweden to this Court applied to
me lately to know, if I had powers that would authorise my
making a treaty with his master in behalf of the United
States. Recollecting a general power, that was formerly
given to me with the other Commissioners, I answered in
the affirmative. He seemed much pleased, and said the
King had directed him to ask the question, and charged
him to tell me that he had so great esteem for me, that it
would be a particular satisfaction to him to have such a
transaction with me. I have perhaps some vanity in repeating
this; but I think too, that it is right that Congress
should know it, and judge if any use may be made of
the reputation of a citizen for the public service. In case
it should be thought fit to employ me in that business, it
will be well to send a more particular power, and proper
instructions. The Ambassador added, that it was a pleasure
to him to think, and he hoped it would be remembered,
that Sweden was the first power in Europe, which
had voluntarily offered its friendship to the United States
without being solicited. This affair should be talked of as
little as possible till completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>I enclose another complaint from Denmark, which I
request you will lay before Congress. I am continually
pestered with complaints from French seamen, who were
with Captain Cunningham in his first cruise from Dunkirk;
from others who were in the Lexington, the Alliance,
&amp;c. being put on board prizes that were retaken, were
never afterwards able to join their respective ships, and so
have been deprived of the wages, &amp;c. due to them. It is
for our national honor, that justice should be done them if
possible; and I wish you to procure an order of Congress
for inquiring into their demands, and satisfying such as
shall be found just. It may be addressed to the Consul.</p>

<p>I enclose a note from M. de Vergennes to me, accompanied
by a memoir relating to a Swiss, who died at
Edenton. If you can procure the information desired, it
will much oblige the French Ambassador in Switzerland.</p>

<p>I have made the addition you directed to the cypher. I
rather prefer the old one of Dumas, perhaps because I
am more used to it. I enclose several letters from that
ancient and worthy friend of our country. He is now
employed as secretary to Mr Adams, and I must, from a
long experience of his zeal and usefulness, beg leave to
recommend him warmly to the consideration of Congress,
with regard to his appointments, which have never been
equal to his merit. As Mr Adams writes me the good
news, that he shall no longer be obliged to draw on me for
his salary, I suppose it will be proper to direct his paying
that which shall be allowed to M. Dumas.</p>

<p>Be pleased to present my duty to the Congress, and believe
me to be, with great esteem and regard,</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 29th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>In mine of the 25th instant, I omitted mentioning, that
at the repeated earnest instances of Mr Laurens, who had
given such expectations to the Ministry in England, when
his parole or securities were discharged, as that he could
not think himself at liberty to act in public affairs, till the
parole of Lord Cornwallis was absolved by me in exchange,
I sent to that General the paper of which the
enclosed is a copy;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and I see by the English papers,
that his Lordship immediately on the receipt of it appeared
at Court, and has taken his seat in the House of
Peers, which he did not before think was warrantable.
My authority for doing this appeared questionable to myself,
but Mr Laurens judged it deducible from that respecting
General Burgoyne, and, by his letters to me, seemed
so unhappy till it was done, that I ventured it, with a
clause, however, as you will see, reserving to Congress
the approbation or disallowance of it.</p>

<p>The enabling act is now said to be passed, but no copy
of it is yet received here, so that as the bill first printed
has suffered alterations in passing through Parliament, and
we know not what they are, the treaty with us is not yet
commenced. Mr Grenville expects his courier in a few
days, with the answer of his Court to a paper given him
on the part of this. That answer will probably afford us a
clearer understanding of the intentions of the British Ministry,
which for some weeks past have appeared somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
equivocal and uncertain. It looks as if, since their late
success in the West Indies, they a little repented of the
advances they had made in their declarations, respecting
the acknowledgment of our independence; and we have
pretty good information, that some of the Ministers still
flatter the King with the hope of recovering his sovereignty
over us, on the same terms as are now making
with Ireland. However willing we might have been at the
commencement of this contest to have accepted such conditions,
be assured we can have no safety in them at
present. The King hates us most cordially. If he is once
admitted to any degree of power and government among
us, however limited, it will soon be extended by corruption,
artifice, and force, till we are reduced to absolute subjection,
and that the more easily, as, by receiving him again
for our King, we shall draw upon us the contempt of all
Europe, who now admire and respect us, and shall never
again find a friend to assist us. There are, it is said,
great divisions in the Ministry on other points as well as
this, and those who aim at engrossing the power, flatter
the King with this project of reunion, and, it is said, have
much reliance on the operations of private agents sent into
America to dispose minds there in favor of it, and to bring
about a separate treaty there with General Carleton. I
have not the least apprehension, that Congress will give into
this scheme, it being inconsistent with our treaties, as well
as with our interest; but I think it will be well to watch
the emissaries, and secure, or banish immediately, such as
shall be found tampering and stirring up the people to call
for it.</p>

<p>The firm united resolution of France, Spain, and Holland
joined with ours, not to treat of a particular, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
general peace, notwithstanding the separate tempting offers
to each, will in the end give us the command of that
peace. Every one of the other powers see clearly its interest
in this, and persists in that resolution. The Congress
I am persuaded are as clear sighted as any of them,
and will not depart from the system, which has been
attended with so much success, and promises to make
America soon both great and happy.</p>

<p>I have just received a letter from Mr Laurens, dated at
Lyons, on his journey into the south of France for his
health. Mr Jay will write also by this opportunity.</p>

<h2>JOURNAL</h2>

<h3>OF THE NEGOTIATION FOR PEACE WITH GREAT BRITAIN</h3>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<h3>FROM MARCH 21ST TO JULY 1ST, 1782.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy May 9th, 1782.
</p>

<p>As since the change of the Ministry of England, some
serious professions have been made of their disposition to
peace, and of their readiness to enter into a general treaty
for that purpose; and as the concerns and claims of five
nations are to be discussed in that treaty, which must
therefore be interesting to the present age, and to posterity,
I am inclined to keep a journal of the proceedings
as far as they come to my knowledge, and to make it
more complete, I will first endeavor to recollect what has
already past. Great affairs sometimes take their rise from
small circumstances. My good friend and neighbor Madame
Brillon, being at Nice all last winter for her health,
with her very amiable family, wrote to me that she had
met with some English gentry there, whose acquaintance
proved agreeable; among them she named Lord Cholmondely,
who she said had promised to call in his return to
England, and drink tea with us at Passy. He left Nice
sooner than she supposed, and came to Paris long before
her. On the 21st of March, I received the following note.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Lord Cholmondely's compliments to Dr Franklin; he
sets out for London tomorrow evening, and should be glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
to see him for five minutes before he went. Lord Cholmondely
will call upon him at any time in the morning he
shall please to appoint.</p>

<p>Thursday evening. Hotel de Chartres."</p></blockquote>

<p>I wrote for answer, that I should be at home all the
next morning, and glad to see his Lordship if he did me
the honor of calling on me. He came accordingly. I
had before no personal knowledge of this nobleman. We
talked of our friends whom he left at Nice, then of affairs
in England, and the late resolutions of the Commons on
Mr Conway's motion. He told me that he knew Lord
Shelburne had a great regard for me, that he was sure
his Lordship would be pleased to hear from me, and that
if I would write a line he should have a pleasure in carrying
it. On which I wrote the following.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO LORD SHELBURNE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, March 22d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My Lord,
</p>

<p>"Lord Cholmondely having kindly offered to take a letter
from me to your Lordship, I embrace the opportunity of
assuring the continuance of my ancient respect for your
talents and virtues, and of congratulating you on the returning
good disposition of your country in favor of America,
which appears in the late resolutions of the Commons.
I am persuaded it will have good effects. I hope it will
tend to produce a <em>general peace</em>, which I am sure your
Lordship, with all good men, desires, which I wish to see
before I die, and to which I shall, with infinite pleasure,
contribute everything in my power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>"Your friends, the Abbé Morellet and Madame Helvetius,
are well. You have made the latter very happy by your
present of gooseberry bushes, which arrived in five days,
and in excellent order. With great and sincere esteem,
I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">

</p>

<p>Soon after this we heard from England, that a total
change had taken place in the Ministry, and that Lord
Shelburne had come in as Secretary of State. But I
thought no more of my letter, till an old friend and near
neighbor of mine many years in London appeared at
Passy, and introduced a Mr Oswald, whom he said had a
great desire to see me, and Mr Oswald, after some little
conversation, gave me the following letters from
Lord Shelburne and Mr Laurens.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>LORD SHELBURNE TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, April 6th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have been favored with your letter, and am much
obliged by your remembrance. I find myself returned
early to the same situation, which you remember me to
have occupied nineteen years ago, and I should be very glad
to talk to you as I did then, and afterwards in 1767, upon
the means of promoting the happiness of mankind, a subject
much more agreeable to my nature, than the best concerted
plans for spreading misery and devastation. I have
had a high opinion of the compass of your mind, and
of your foresight. I have often been beholden to both, and
shall be glad to be so again, as far as is compatible with
your situation. Your letter discovering the same disposition,
has made me send to you Mr Oswald. I have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
a longer acquaintance with him, than even I have had the
pleasure to have with you. I believe him an honest man,
and, after consulting some of our common friends, I have
thought him the fittest for the purpose. He is a pacifical
man, and conversant in those negotiations, which are most
interesting to mankind. This has made me prefer him to
any of our speculative friends, or to any person of higher
rank. He is fully apprized of my mind, and you may
give full credit to everything he assures you of. At the
same time, if any other channel occurs to you, I am ready
to embrace it. I wish to retain the same simplicity and
good faith, which subsisted between us in transactions of
less importance. I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>HENRY LAURENS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, April 7th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>"Richard Oswald, Esquire, who will do me the honor of
delivering this, is a gentleman of the strictest candor and
integrity. I dare give such assurances from an experience
little short of thirty years, and to add, you will be perfectly
safe in conversing freely with him on the business he
will introduce, a business, which Mr Oswald has disinterestedly
engaged in, from motives of benevolence, and from
the choice of the man a persuasion follows, that the Electors
mean to be in earnest.</p>

<p>"Some people in this country, who have too long indulged
themselves in abusing everything American, have been
pleased to circulate an opinion, that Dr Franklin is a very
cunning man, in answer to which, I have remarked to Mr
Oswald, 'Dr Franklin knows very well how to manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
a cunning man, but when the Doctor converses, or treats
with a man of candor, there is no man more candid than
himself.' I do not know whether you will ultimately
agree on political sketches, but I am sure, as gentlemen,
you will part very well pleased with each other. Should
you, Sir, think proper to communicate to me your sentiments
and advice on our affairs, the more amply the more
acceptable, and probably the more serviceable; Mr Oswald
will take charge of your despatches, and afford a secure
means of conveyance.</p>

<p>"To this gentleman I refer you for general information of
a journey, which I am immediately to make, partly in his
company, at Ostend, to file off for the Hague. I feel a
willingness, infirm as I am, to attempt doing as much good
as can be expected from such a prisoner upon parole. As
General Burgoyne is certainly exchanged, (a circumstance,
by the by, which possibly might have embarrassed us, had
your late propositions been accepted) may I presume at
my return to offer another Lieutenant General, now in
England, a prisoner upon parole, in exchange; or what
shall I offer in exchange for myself, a thing in my own
estimation of no great value? I have the honor to be,
with great respect, and, permit me to add, great reverence,
Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
HENRY LAURENS."
</p>

<p>I entered into conversation with Mr Oswald. He was
represented in the letter as fully apprized of Lord Shelburne's
mind, and I was desirous of knowing it. All I
could learn was, that the new Ministry sincerely wished
for a peace, that they considered the object of the war,
to France and America, as obtained. That if the independence
of the United States was agreed to, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
no other point in dispute, and therefore nothing to hinder
a pacification. That they were ready to treat of <em>Peace</em>,
but he intimated, that if France should insist upon terms
too humiliating to England, they could still continue the
war, having yet great strength, and many resources left.
I let him know, that America would not treat but in concert
with France, and that my colleagues not being here,
I could do nothing of importance in the affair; but that, if
he pleased, I would present him to M. de Vergennes,
Secretary of State for foreign Affairs. He consenting,
I wrote and sent the following letter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 15th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"An English nobleman, Lord Cholmondely, lately returning
from Italy, called upon me here, at the time when
we received the news of the first resolutions of the House
of Commons, relating to America. In conversation he
said, that he knew his friend, Lord Shelburne, had a great
regard for me, that it would be pleasing to him to hear of
my welfare, and receive a line from me, of which he, Lord
Cholmondely, should like to be the bearer, adding, if there
should be a change of Ministry, he believed Lord Shelburne
would be employed. I thereupon wrote a few
lines, of which I enclose a copy. This day I received an
answer, which I also enclose, together with another letter
from Mr Laurens. They both, as your Excellency will see,
recommend the bearer, Mr Oswald, as a very honest, sensible
man. I have had a little conversation with him. He
tells me, that there has been a desire of making a separate
peace with America, and continuing the war with France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and Spain, but that now all wise people give up that idea
as impracticable, and it is his private opinion, that the
Ministry do sincerely desire a <em>general peace</em>, and that they
will readily come into it, provided France does not insist
upon conditions too humiliating for England, in which case
she will make great and violent efforts, rather than submit
to them, and that much is still in her power, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I told the gentleman, that I could not enter into particulars
with him, but in concert with the Ministers of this
Court. And I proposed introducing him to your Excellency,
after communicating to you the letters he had
brought me, in case you should think fit to see him, with
which he appeared to be pleased. I intend waiting on you
tomorrow, when you will please to acquaint me with your
intentions, and favor me with your counsels. He had
heard nothing of Forth's mission, and the old Ministry had
not acquainted the new with that transaction. Mr Laurens
came over with him in the same vessel, and went from
Ostend to Holland. With great respect, I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>The next day, being at Court with the Foreign Ministers,
as usual on Tuesdays, I saw M. de Vergennes, who
acquainted me, that he had caused the letters to be translated,
had considered the contents, and should like to see
Mr Oswald. We agreed that the interview should be on
Wednesday at 10 o'clock. Immediately on my return
home, I wrote to Mr Oswald, acquainting him with what
had passed at Versailles, and proposing, that he should be
with me at half past eight the next morning, in order to
proceed thither. I received from him the following
answer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>


<p class="head">
Paris, April 16th.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have the honor of yours by the bearer, and shall be
sure to wait on you tomorrow, at half past eight, and am,
with much respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
RICHARD OSWALD."
</p>

<p>He came accordingly, and we arrived at Versailles
punctually. M. de Vergennes received him with much
civility. Mr Oswald not being ready in speaking French,
M. de Rayneval interpreted. Mr Oswald at first thought
of sending an express, with the account of the conversation,
which continued near an hour, and was offered a
passport, but finally concluded to go himself; and I wrote
the next day the letter following.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO LORD SHELBURNE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 18th, 1782.
</p>

<p class="open">"My Lord,
</p>

<p>"I have received the letter your Lordship did me the
honor of writing to me on the 6th instant. I congratulate
you on your new appointment to the honorable and important
office you formerly filled so worthily, which must
be so far pleasing to you, as it affords you more opportunities
of doing good, and of serving your country essentially
in its great concerns.</p>

<p>"I have conversed a good deal with Mr Oswald, and am
much pleased with him. He appears to me a wise and
honest man. I acquainted him, that I was commissioned,
with others, to treat of and conclude a peace. That full
powers were given us for that purpose, and that the Congress
promised in good faith to ratify, confirm, and cause
to be faithfully observed, the treaty we should make; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
that we would not treat separately from France, and I
proposed introducing him to the Count de Vergennes,
to whom I communicated your Lordship's letter containing
Mr Oswald's character, as a foundation for the interviews.
He will acquaint you, that the assurance he gave of His
Britannic Majesty's good dispositions towards peace was
well received, and assurances returned of the same good
dispositions in His Most Christian Majesty.</p>

<p>"With regard to circumstances relative to a treaty, M. de
Vergennes observed, that the King's engagements were
such, that he could not treat without the concurrence of
his allies, that the treaty should, therefore, be for a general,
not a partial peace, that if the parties were disposed to
finish the war speedily by themselves, it would perhaps be
best to treat at Paris, as an Ambassador from Spain was
already there, and the Commissioners from America might
easily and soon be assembled there. Or, if they chose to
make use of the proposed mediation, they might treat at
Vienna; but that the King was so truly willing to put a
speedy end to the war, that he would agree to any place
the King of England should think proper.</p>

<p>"I leave the rest of the conversation to be related to your
Lordship by Mr Oswald, and that he might do it more
easily and fully, than he could by letter, I was of opinion
with him, that it would be best he should return immediately
and do it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i>. Being myself but one of the
four persons now in Europe, commissioned by the Congress
to treat of peace, I can make no propositions of
much importance without them. I can only express my
wish, that, if Mr Oswald returns hither, he may bring with
him the agreement of your Court to treat for a general
peace, and the proposal of place and time, that I may immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
write to Messrs Adams, Laurens, and Jay. I
suppose, that in this case, your Lordship will think it proper
to have Mr Laurens discharged from the engagements
he entered into, when he was admitted to bail. I desire
no other channel of communication between us, than that
of Mr Oswald, which I think your Lordship has chosen
with much judgment. He will be witness of my acting
with all the simplicity and good faith, which you do me the
honor to expect from me, and if he is enabled, when he
returns hither, to communicate more fully your Lordship's
mind on the principal points to be settled, I think it may
contribute much to the blessed work our hearts are engaged
in.</p>

<p>"By the Act of Parliament relative to American prisoners,
I see the King is empowered to exchange them. I
hope those you have in England and Ireland may be sent
home soon to their country, in flags of truce, and exchanged
for an equal number of your people. Permit me to
add, that I think it would be well if some kindness were
mixed in the transaction, with regard to their comfortable
accommodation on shipboard, as these poor unfortunate
people have been long absent from their families and
friends, and rather hardly treated. With great and sincere
respect, I have the honor to be, my Lord, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>To the account contained in this letter, of what passed
in the conversation with the Minister, I should add his
frank declaration, that, as the foundation of a good and
durable peace should be laid in justice, whenever a treaty
was entered upon, he had several demands of justice to
make from England. Of this, says he, I give you previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
notice. What these demands were, he did not particularly
say. One occurred to me, viz. reparation for the
injury done in taking a number of French ships by surprise,
before the declaration of the preceding war, contrary to the
law of nations. Mr Oswald seemed to wish to obtain some
propositions to carry back with him, but M. de Vergennes
said to him very properly, there are four nations engaged
in the war against you, who cannot, till they have consulted
and know each other's minds, be ready to make
propositions. Your Court being without allies and alone,
knowing its own mind, can express it immediately. It is
therefore more natural to expect the first proposition from
you.</p>

<p>On our return from Versailles, Mr Oswald took occasion
to impress me with ideas, that the present weakness of the
government of England, with regard to continuing the
war, was owing chiefly to the division of sentiments about
it. That in case France should make demands too humiliating
for England to submit to, the spirit of the nation
would be roused, unanimity would prevail, and resources
would not be wanting. He said there was no want of
money in the nation, that the chief difficulty lay in the
finding out new taxes to raise it, and, perhaps, that difficulty
might be avoided by shutting up the Exchequer,
stopping the payment of the interests of the public funds,
and applying that money to the support of the war. I
made no reply to this, for I did not desire to discourage
their stopping payment, which I considered as cutting the
throat of the public credit, and a means of adding fresh
exasperation against them with the neighboring nations.
Such menaces were besides an encouragement with me,
remembering the adage, that <em>they who threaten are afraid</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>The next morning, when I had written the above letter
to Lord Shelburne, I went with it to Mr Oswald's lodgings,
and gave it to him to read before I sealed it, that in case
anything might be in it with which he was not satisfied,
it might be corrected; but he expressed himself much
pleased.</p>

<p>In going to him, I had also in view the entering into a
conversation, which might draw out something of the mind
of his Court on the subject of Canada and Nova Scotia.
I had thrown some loose thoughts on paper, which I intended
to serve as memorandums for my discourse, but
without a fixed intention of showing them to him. On his
saying that he was obliged to me for the good opinion I
had expressed of him to Lord Shelburne in my letter, and
assuring me, that he had entertained the same of me, I
observed, that I perceived Lord S. had placed great confidence
in him, and as we had happily the same in each
other, we might possibly, by a free communication of sentiments,
and a previous settling of our own minds on some
of the important points, be the means of great good, by
impressing our sentiments on the minds of those with
whom they might have influence, and where their being
received might be of importance. I then remarked, that
his nation seemed to desire a reconciliation, that to obtain
this, the party which had been the aggressor and had cruelly
treated the other, should show some marks of concern
for what was past, and some disposition to make reparation;
that perhaps there were things, which America
might demand by way of reparation, and which England
might yield, and that the effect would be vastly greater if
they appeared to be voluntary, and to spring from returning
good will; that I, therefore, wished England would think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of offering something to relieve those, who had suffered by
its scalping and burning parties. Lives indeed could not
be restored nor compensated, but the villages and houses
wantonly destroyed might be rebuilt, &amp;c. I then touched
upon the affair of Canada, and, as in a former conversation
he had mentioned his opinion, that the giving up of
that country to the English, at the last peace, had been a
politic act in France, for that it had weakened the ties between
England and her Colonies, and that he himself
had predicted from it the late revolution, I spoke of the
occasions of future quarrel that might be produced by her
continuing to hold it, hinting at the same time, but not expressing
too plainly, that such a situation, to us so dangerous,
would necessarily oblige us to cultivate and strengthen
our union with France. He appeared much struck with
my discourse, and, as I frequently looked at my paper, he
desired to see it. After some little delay, I allowed him to
read it; the following is an exact copy.</p>


<h3>NOTES FOR CONVERSATION.</h3>

<p>"To make a peace durable, what may give occasion for
future wars should if practicable be removed.</p>

<p>"The territory of the United States and that of Canada,
by long extended frontiers, touch each other.</p>

<p>"The settlers on the frontiers of the American provinces
are generally the most disorderly of the people,
who, being far removed from the eye and control of their
respective governments, are more bold in committing offences
against neighbors, and are forever occasioning complaints
and furnishing matter for fresh differences between
their States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>"By the late debates in Parliament, and public writings,
it appears that Britain desires a <em>reconciliation</em> with the
Americans. It is a sweet word. It means much more
than a mere peace, and what is heartily to be wished for.
Nations make a peace whenever they are both weary of
making war. But if one of them has made war upon the
other unjustly, and has wantonly and unnecessarily done
it great injuries, and refuses reparation, there may, for
the present, be peace, the resentment of those injuries
will remain, and will break out again in vengeance when
occasions offer. These occasions will be watched for by
one side, feared by the other, and the peace will never be
secure; nor can any cordiality subsist between them.</p>

<p>"Many houses and villages have been burnt in America
by the English and their allies, the Indians. I do not
know that the Americans will insist on reparation; perhaps
they may. But would it not be better for England
to offer it? Nothing would have a greater tendency to
conciliate, and much of the future commerce and returning
intercourse between the two countries may depend
on the reconciliation. Would not the advantage of reconciliation
by such means be greater than the expense?</p>

<p>"If then a way can be proposed, which may tend to
efface the memory of injuries, at the same time that it
takes away the occasions of fresh quarrels and mischief,
will it not be worth considering, especially if it can be
done, not only without expense, but be a means of saving?</p>

<p>"Britain possesses Canada. Her chief advantage from
that possession consists in the trade for peltry. Her expenses
in governing and defending that settlement must be
considerable. It might be humiliating to her to give it up
on the demand of America. Perhaps America will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
demand it; some of her political rulers may consider the
fear of such a neighbor, as a means of keeping the thirteen
States more united among themselves, and more
attentive to military discipline. But on the mind of the
people in general, would it not have an excellent effect, if
Britain should voluntarily offer to give up this Province;
though on these conditions, that she shall in all times
coming have and enjoy the right of free trade thither, unincumbered
with any duties whatsoever; that so much of
the vacant lands there shall be sold, as will raise a sum
sufficient to pay for the houses burnt by the British troops,
and their Indians; and also to indemnify the royalists for
the confiscation of their estates?</p>

<p>"This is mere conversation matter between Mr Oswald
and Mr Franklin, as the former is not empowered to make
propositions, and the latter cannot make any without the
concurrence of his colleagues."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>He then told me, that nothing in his judgment could be
clearer, more satisfactory and convincing, than the reasonings
in that paper; that he would do his utmost to impress
Lord Shelburne with them; that, as his memory might not
do them justice, and it would be impossible for him to express
them so well, or state them so clearly as I had written
them, he begged I would let him take the paper with
him, assuring me that he would return it safely into my
hands. I at length complied with this request also. We
parted exceeding good friends, and he set out for London.</p>

<p>By the first opportunity after his departure, I wrote the
following letter to Mr Adams, and sent the papers therein
mentioned, that he might fully be apprized of the proceedings.
I omitted only the paper of <em>Notes for Conversation</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
with Mr Oswald, but gave the substance, as appears in the
letter. The reason of my omitting it was, that, on reflection,
I was not pleased with my having hinted a reparation
to tories for their forfeited estates, and I was a little
ashamed of my weakness in permitting the paper to go out of my hands.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 20th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I hope your Excellency received the copy of our instructions,
which I sent by the courier from Versailles,
some weeks since. I wrote to you on the 13th, to go by
Captain Smedley, and sent a packet of correspondence with
Mr Hartley. Smedley did not leave Paris so soon as I
expected; but you should have it by this time.</p>

<p>"With this I send a fresh correspondence, which I have
been drawn into, viz. 1st, A letter I sent to Lord Shelburne
before he was a Minister. 2dly, His answer since
he was a Minister, by Mr Oswald. 3dly, A letter from
Mr Laurens. 4thly, My letter to M. de Vergennes.
5thly, My answer to Lord Shelburne. 6thly, My answer
to Mr Laurens. 7thly, Copy of Digges's report. These
papers will inform you pretty well of what passed between
me and Mr Oswald, except that in a conversation at parting,
I mentioned to him, that I observed they spoke much
in England of obtaining a <em>reconciliation</em> with the Colonies;
that this was more than a peace; that the latter might
possibly be obtained without the former; that the cruel
injuries constantly done us by burning our towns, &amp;c. had
made deep impressions of resentment that would long remain;
that much of the advantage to the commerce of
England from a peace would depend on a <em>reconciliation</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
that the peace without reconciliation would probably not
be durable; that after a quarrel between friends, nothing
tended so much to <em>conciliate</em>, as offers made by the aggressor
of reparation for injuries done by him in his
passion. And I hinted, that if England should make us a
voluntary offer of Canada, expressly for that purpose, it
might have a good effect.</p>

<p>"Mr Oswald liked much the idea, and said they were
too much straitened for money to make us pecuniary reparation,
but he should endeavor to persuade their doing it
this way. He is furnished with a passport to go and return
by Calais, and I expect him back in ten or twelve
days. I wish you and Mr Laurens could be here when
he arrives, for I shall much want your advice, and cannot
act without your concurrence. If the present crisis of
your affairs prevents your coming, I hope, at least, Mr
Laurens will be here, and we must communicate with you
by expresses, for your letters to me by post are generally
opened. I shall write by the next post, requesting Mr
Jay to be here also as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"I received your letter advising of your draft on me for
a quarter's salary, which will be duly honored. With great
esteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>Supposing Mr Laurens to be in Holland with Mr
Adams, I, at the same time, wrote to him the following
letter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<h3>TO HENRY LAURENS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 20th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I received, by Mr Oswald, the letter you did me the
honor of writing to me on the 7th instant. He brought
me also a letter from Lord Shelburne, which gave him the
same good character that you do, adding, 'He is fully apprized
of my mind, and you may give full credit to everything
he assures you of.' Mr Oswald, however, could
give me no other particulars of his Lordship's mind, but
that he was sincerely disposed to peace. As the message
seemed, therefore, rather intended to procure or receive
propositions than to make any, I told Mr Oswald that I
could make none but in concurrence with my colleagues
in the commission, and that if we were together, we should
not treat but in conjunction with France; and I proposed
introducing him to M. de Vergennes, which he accepted.</p>

<p>"He made to that Minister the same declaration of the
disposition of England to peace, who replied, that France
had assuredly the same good disposition; that a treaty
might be immediately begun, but it must be for a <em>general</em>,
not a <em>particular</em> peace. That, as to the place, he thought
Paris might be the most convenient, as Spain had here
already an Ambassador, and the American Commissioners
could easily be assembled here; this, upon a supposition of
the parties treating directly with each other without the
intervention of mediators, but if the mediation was to be
used, it might be at Vienna. The King, his master, however,
was so truly disposed to peace, that he would agree
to any place that the King of England should choose, and
would, at the treaty, give proof of the confidence that
might be placed in any engagements he should then enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
into, by the fidelity and exactitude with which he should
observe those he already had with his present allies.</p>

<p>"Mr Oswald is returned with these general answers by
the way of Calais, and expects to be here again in a few
days. I wish it might be convenient for you and Mr
Adams to be here at the same time; but if the present
critical situation of affairs there, makes his being in Holland
necessary just now, I hope you may, nevertheless, be
here, bringing with you his opinion and advice. I have
proposed to Lord Shelburne, to discharge you from the
obligations you entered into at the time of your enlargement,
that you may act more freely in the treaty he desires.</p>

<p>"I had done myself the honor of writing to you a few
days before the arrival of Mr Oswald. My letter went by
Mr Young, your Secretary, and enclosed a copy of your
commission, with an offer of money if you had occasion
for any. Hoping that you will not return to England before
you have been at Paris, I forbear enlarging on the
state of our affairs here and in Spain. M. de Vergennes
told me he should be very glad to see you here. I found
Mr Oswald to answer perfectly the character you gave me
of him, and was much pleased with him. I have the
honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>Just after I had despatched these letters, I received the
following from Mr Adams.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>JOHN ADAMS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, April 16th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"Yesterday noon, Mr William Vaughan, of London, came
to my house with Mr Laurens, the son of the President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
and brought me a line from the latter, and told me the
President was at Haerlem, and desired to see me. I went
to Haerlem and found my old friend at the Golden Lion.
He told me he was come partly for his health and the
pleasure of seeing me, and partly to converse with me,
and see if he had at present just ideas and views of things,
at least to see if we agreed in sentiment, having been
desired by several of the new Ministry to do so. I asked
him if he was at liberty? He said no, that he was still
under parole, but at liberty to say what he pleased to me.
I told him that I could not communicate to him, being
a prisoner, even his own instructions, nor enter into any
consultation with him as one of our colleagues in the commission
for peace; that all I should say to him would be
as one private citizen conversing with another; but that
upon all such occasions, I should reserve a right to communicate
whatever should pass to our colleagues and allies.</p>

<p>"He said that Lord Shelburne, and others of the new
Ministers, were anxious to know whether there was any
authority to treat of a separate peace, and whether there
could be an accommodation upon any terms short of independence;
that he had ever answered them that nothing
short of an express or tacit acknowledgment of our independence,
in his opinion, would ever be accepted, and that
no treaty ever would, or could be made separate from
France. He asked me, if his answers had been right? I
told him that I was fully of that opinion. He said that the
new Ministers had received Digges's report, but his character
was such, that they did not choose to depend upon
it; that a person by the name of Oswald, I think, set off
for Paris to see you, about the same time he came away
to see me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>"I desired him, between him and me, to consider, without
saying anything of it to the Ministry, whether we could
ever have a real peace, with Canada or Nova Scotia in the
hands of the English? And whether we ought not to insist,
at least, upon a stipulation, that they should keep no standing
army, or regular troops, nor erect any fortifications
upon the frontiers of either? That, at present, I saw no
motive that we had to be anxious for a peace, and if the
nation was not ripe for it upon proper terms, we might
wait patiently till they should be so.</p>

<p>"I found the old gentleman perfectly sound in his system
of politics. He has a very poor opinion, both of the integrity
and abilities of the new Ministry, as well as the old.
He thinks they know not what they are about; that they
are spoiled by the same insincerity, duplicity, falsehood,
and corruption, with the former. Lord Shelburne still flatters
the King with ideas of conciliation and a separate
peace, &amp;c. yet the nation, and the best men in it, are for
universal peace and an express acknowledgment of American
independence, and many of the best are for giving up
Canada and Nova Scotia. His design seemed to be solely
to know how far Digges's report was true. After an hour
or two of conversation, I returned to Amsterdam, and left
him to return to London.</p>

<p>"These are all but artifices to raise the stocks, and if you
think of any method to put a stop to them, I will cheerfully
concur with you. They now know sufficiently, that
our commission is to treat of a general peace, and with
persons vested with equal powers; and if you agree to it,
I will, never to see another messenger that is not a Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>"It is expected that the seventh Province, Guelderland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
will this day acknowledge American Independence. I
think we are in such a situation now, that we ought not,
upon any consideration, to think of a truce, or anything
short of an express acknowledgment of the sovereignty of
the United States. I should be glad, however, to know
your sentiments upon this point. I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

</p>

<p>To the above, I immediately wrote the following answer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, April 21st, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have just received the honor of yours, dated the 16th
instant, acquainting me with the interview between your
Excellency and Mr Laurens. I am glad to learn, that his
political sentiments coincide with ours, and that there is a
disposition in England to give us up Canada and Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p>"I like your idea of seeing no more messengers, that are
not Plenipotentiaries; but I cannot refuse seeing again Mr
Oswald, as the Minister here considered the letter to me
from Lord Shelburne as a kind of authentication given
that messenger, and expects his return with some explicit
propositions. I shall keep you advised of whatever passes.</p>

<p>"The late act of Parliament, for exchanging American
prisoners <em>as prisoners of war</em>, according to the law of
nations, <em>anything in their commitments notwithstanding</em>,
seems to me a renunciation of their pretensions to try our
people as subjects guilty of high treason, and to be a kind
of tacit acknowledgment of our independency. Having
taken this step, it will be less difficult for them to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
it expressly. They are now preparing transports to
send the prisoners home. I yesterday sent the passports
desired of me.</p>

<p>"Sir George Grand shows me a letter from Mr Fizeaux,
in which he says, that if advantage is taken of the
present enthusiasm in favor of America, a loan might be
obtained in Holland, of five or six millions of florins, for
America, and if their house is empowered to open it, he
has no doubt of success; but that no time is to be lost. I
earnestly recommend this matter to you, as extremely
necessary to the operations of our financier, Mr Morris,
who, not knowing that the greatest part of the last five
millions had been consumed by purchase of goods, &amp;c. in
Europe, writes me advice of large drafts, that he shall be
obliged to make upon me this summer.</p>

<p>"This Court has granted us six millions of livres for the
current year; but it will fall vastly short of our occasions,
there being large orders to fulfil, and near two millions and
a half to pay M. Beaumarchais, besides the interest, bills,
&amp;c. The house of Fizeaux and Grand is now appointed
banker for France, by a special commission from the King,
and will, on that, as well as other accounts be, in my opinion,
the fittest for this operation. Your Excellency being
on the spot can better judge of the terms, &amp;c. and manage
with that house the whole business, in which I should
be glad to have no other concern than that of receiving assistance
from it, when pressed by the dreaded drafts. With
great respect, I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>In reply to this, Mr Adams wrote to me as follows.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>


<h3>JOHN ADAMS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Amsterdam, May 2d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I am honored with your favor of the 20th of April, and
Mr Laurens's son proposes to carry the letter to his father
forthwith. The instructions by the courier from Versailles
came safe, as all other despatches by that channel no
doubt will do. The correspondence with Mr Hartley I
received by Captain Smedley, and will take the first good
opportunity by a private hand to return it, as well as that
with the Earl of Shelburne.</p>

<p>"Mr Laurens and Mr Jay will, I hope, be able to meet
at Paris, but when it will be in my power to go, I know
not. Your present negotiation about peace falls in very
well to aid a proposition, which I am instructed to make, as
soon as the Court of Versailles shall judge proper, of a
triple or quadruple alliance. This matter, the treaty of
commerce, which is now under deliberation, and the loan,
will render it improper for me to quit this station, unless in
case of necessity. If there is a real disposition to permit
Canada to accede to the American association, I should
think there would be no great difficulty in adjusting all
things between England and America, provided our allies
are contented too. In a former letter, I hinted that I
thought an express acknowledgment of our independence
might now be insisted on, but I did not mean that we
should insist upon such an article in the treaty. If they
make a treaty of peace with the United States of America,
this is acknowledgment enough for me.</p>

<p>"The affair of a loan gives me much anxiety and fatigue.
It is true I may open a loan for five millions, but I confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
I have no hopes of obtaining so much; the money is not to
be had. Cash is not infinite in this country. Their profits
by trade have been ruined for two or three years, and
there are loans open for France, Spain, England, Russia,
Sweden, Denmark, and several other powers, as well as
their own national, provincial, and collegiate loans. The
undertakers are already loaded with burthens greater than
they can bear, and all the brokers in the republic are so
engaged, that there is scarcely a ducat to be lent but what
is promised.</p>

<p>"This is the true cause why we should not succeed, yet
they will seek an hundred other pretences. It is considered
such an honor, and such an introduction to American
trade to be the house, that the eagerness to obtain the title
of American banker is prodigious. Various houses have
pretensions, which they set up very high, and let me choose
which I will, I am sure of a cry and a clamor. I have
taken some measures to endeavor to calm the heat, and give
a general satisfaction, but have as yet small hopes of success.
I would strike with any house, that would insure the money,
but none will undertake it now it is offered, although several
were very ready to affirm that they could, when it
began to be talked of. Upon inquiry, they do not find the
money easy to obtain, which I could have told them
before. It is to me, personally, perfectly indifferent which
is the house, and the only question is, which will be able to
do best for the interest of the United States. This question,
however simple, is not easy to answer. But I think
it clear, after very painful and laborious inquiry for a year
and a half, that no house whatever will be able to do
much. Enthusiasm at some times, and in some countries,
may do a great deal, but there has, as yet, been no enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
in this country for America strong enough to
untie many purses. Another year, if the war continues,
perhaps we may do better. I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
JOHN ADAMS."
</p>

<p>During Mr Oswald's absence, I received the following
from Mr Laurens.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>HENRY LAURENS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, April 20th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I wrote to you on the 7th instant, by Mr Oswald, since
which, that is to say, on the 28th, I was honored by the
receipt of your letter of the 12th, enclosing a copy of the
commission for treating for peace, by the hands of Mr
Young. The recognizance exacted from me by the late
Ministry, has been vacated and done away by the present;
these have been pleased to enlarge me without formal conditions,
but, as I would not consent that the United States of
America should be outdone in generosity, however late
the marks appeared on this side, I took upon me to assure
Lord Shelburne, in a letter of acknowledgment for the part,
which his Lordship had taken for obtaining my release, that
Congress would not fail to make a just and adequate return.
The only return in my view, is Lieutenant General Lord
Cornwallis. Congress were pleased sometime ago, to offer
a British Lieutenant General for my ransom, and as I am
informed, a special exchange of Lord Cornwallis for the
same subject was lately in contemplation, it would afford
me very great satisfaction to know, that you will join me in
cancelling the debt of honor, which we have impliedly incurred,
by discharging his Lordship from the obligations of
his parole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>"For my own part, though not a bold adventurer, I think
I shall not commit myself to the risk of censure, by acting
conjunctly with you in such a bargain. I entreat you, Sir,
at least, to reflect on this matter; I shall take the liberty of
requesting your determination when I reach the continent,
which will probably happen in a few days.</p>

<p>"Lord Cornwallis, in a late conversation with me, put
the following case. 'Suppose,' said his Lordship, 'it shall
have been agreed, in America, that Lord Cornwallis should
be offered in exchange for Mr Laurens, don't you think,
although you are now discharged, I ought to reap the intended
benefit?' A reply from the feelings of the heart,
as I love fair play, was prompt; 'Undoubtedly, my Lord,
you ought to be, and shall be, in such case, discharged, and
I will venture to take the burthen upon myself.' Certain
legal forms, I apprehend, rendered the discharge of me,
without condition, unavoidable; but I had previously refused
to accept of myself for nothing, and what I now aim
at was understood as an adequate return; it is not to be
doubted, his Lordship's question was built on this ground.</p>

<p>"I had uniformly and explicitly declared to the people
here, people in the first rank of importance, that nothing
short of independence in terms of our treaty of alliance,
would induce America to treat for truce or peace, and that
no treaty could be had without the consent of our ally first
obtained; in a word, if you mean to have peace, you must
seek for a general peace. The doctrine was ill relished,
especially by those whose power only could set the machine
in motion; but having, since my return from Haerlem,
asserted in very positive terms, that I was confirmed in my
former opinions, the late obduracy has been more than a
little softened, as you will soon learn from the worthy friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
by whom I addressed you on the 7th, who two days ago
set out on his return to Passy and Versailles, with, I believe,
a more permanent commission than the former.</p>

<p>"Accept my thanks, Sir, for the kind offer of a supply of
money. I know too well how much you have been harassed
for that article, and too well, how low our American
finances in Europe are; therefore, if I can possibly avoid
it, I will not further trouble you, nor impoverish them, or
not till the last extremity. Hitherto I have supported myself
without borrowing from anybody, and I am determined
to continue living upon my own stock while it lasts; the
stock is indeed small; my expenses have been and shall
be in a suitable modest style. I pray God to bless you. I
have the honor be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
HENRY LAURENS."
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> "I judged it proper not only to show the peace
commission to Lord Shelburne, but to give his Lordship a
copy of it, from an opinion that it would work no evil,
being shown elsewhere."</p>

<p>On the 4th of May, Mr Oswald returned, and brought
me the following letter from Lord Shelburne.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>LORD SHELBURNE TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Shelburne House, April 20th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have received much satisfaction in being assured by
you, that the qualifications of wisdom and integrity, which
induced me to make choice of Mr Oswald, as the fittest
instrument for the renewal of our friendly intercourse, have
also recommended him so effectually to your approbation
and esteem. I most heartily wish the influence of this first
communication of our mutual sentiments may be extended
to a happy conclusion of all our public differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>"The candor with which the Count de Vergennes expresses
His Most Christian Majesty's sentiments and wishes,
on the subject of a speedy pacification, is a pleasing omen
of its accomplishment. His Majesty is not less decided in
the same sentiments and wishes, and it confirms his Majesty's
Ministers in their intention to act in like manner, as
most consonant to the true dignity of a great nation. In
consequence of these reciprocal advances, Mr Oswald is
sent back to Paris, for the purpose of arranging and settling
with you the preliminaries of time and place. And I have
the pleasure to tell you, that Mr Laurens is already discharged
from those engagements, which he entered into
when he was admitted to bail.</p>

<p>"It is also determined, that Mr Fox, from whose department
that communication is necessarily to proceed, shall
send a proper person, who may confer and settle immediately
with the Count de Vergennes the further measures
and proceedings, which may be judged proper to adopt
toward advancing the prosecution of this important business.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, Mr Oswald is instructed to communicate
to you my thoughts upon the principal objects to be
settled. Transports are actually preparing for the purpose of
conveying your prisoners to America, to be there exchanged,
and we trust, that you will learn, that due attention has
not been wanting to their accommodation and good treatment.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to be, with very sincere respect, dear
Sir, your very faithful and obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
SHELBURNE."
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Having read the letter, I mentioned to Mr Oswald the
part, which refers me to him for his Lordship's sentiments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
He acquainted me, that they were very sincerely disposed
to peace; that the whole Ministry concurred in the same
disposition; that a good deal of confidence was placed in
my character for open, honest dealing; that it was also
generally believed, I had still remaining some part of my
ancient affection and regard for Old England, and it was
hoped it might appear on this occasion. He then showed
me an extract from the Ministers of Council, but did not
leave the paper with me. As well as I can remember, it
was to this purpose.</p>

<p>"At a Cabinet Council, held April 27th, 1782, Present,
Lord Rockingham, Lord Chancellor, Lord President, Lord
Camden, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the number of fifteen or twenty, being
all Ministers, and great officers of State,</p>

<p>"It was proposed to represent to his Majesty, that it
would be well for Mr Oswald to return to Doctor Franklin
and acquaint him, that it is agreed to treat for a general
peace, and at Paris; and that the principal points in contemplation
are, the allowing of American Independence, on
condition that England be put into the same situation, that
she was left in by the peace of 1763."</p>

<p>Mr Oswald also informed me, that he had conversed
with Lord Shelburne on the subject of my paper of <em>Notes</em>,
relating to reconciliation. That he had shown him the
paper, and had been prevailed on to leave it with him a
night, but it was on his Lordship's solemn promise of returning
it, which had been complied with, and he now returned
it to me. That it seemed to have made an impression,
and he had reason to believe that matter might be
settled to our satisfaction towards the end of the treaty; but
in his own mind he wished it might not be mentioned at
the beginning. That his Lordship indeed said, he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
imagined reparation would be expected, and he wondered
I should not know whether it was intended to demand it.
Finally, Mr Oswald acquainted me, that as the business
now likely to be brought forward more particularly appertained
to the department of the other Secretary, Mr Fox,
he was directed to announce another agent coming from
that department, who might be expected every day, viz.
the honorable Mr Grenville, brother to Lord Temple, and
son of the famous Mr George Grenville, formerly Chancellor
of the Exchequer. I immediately wrote the following
note to the Count de Vergennes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 4th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have the honor to acquaint your Excellency, that Mr
Oswald is just returned from London, and is now with me.
He has delivered me a letter from Lord Shelburne, which
I enclose for your perusal, together with a copy of my letter,
to which it is an answer. He tells me, that it has
been agreed in Council to treat at Paris, and to treat of a
<em>general peace</em>; and that, as it is more particularly in the
department of Mr Fox to regulate the circumstantials, a
gentleman, Mr Grenville, to be sent by him for that purpose,
may be daily expected here. Mr Oswald will wait
on your Excellency whenever you shall think fit to receive
him. I am, with respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>And the next day I received the following answer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="head">
Versailles, May 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write to me the 4th instant, as also those which accompanied
it. I will see you with your friend, with pleasure,
at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
DE VERGENNES."
</p>

<p>Accordingly, on Monday morning I went with Mr Oswald
to Versailles, and we saw the Minister. Mr Oswald
acquainted him with the disposition of his Court to treat
for a general peace, and at Paris; and he announced Mr
Grenville, who he said was to set out about the same time
with him, but as he would probably come by way of Ostend,
might be a few days longer on the road. Some
general conversation passed, agreeable enough, but not of
importance.</p>

<p>In our return, Mr Oswald repeated to me his opinion,
that the affair of Canada would be settled to our satisfaction,
and his wish that it might not be mentioned, till towards
the end of the treaty. He intimated too, that it was
apprehended, the greatest obstructions in the treaty might
come from the part of Spain; but said, if she was unreasonable,
there were means to bring her to reason. That
Russia was a friend to England, had lately made great discoveries
on the back of North America, could make establishments
there, and might easily transport an army
from Kamsckatka to the Coast of Mexico, and conquer all
those countries. This appeared a little visionary at present,
but I did not dispute it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>On the whole, I was able to draw so little from Mr Oswald
of the sentiments of Lord Shelburne, who had mentioned
him as intrusted with the communication of them,
that I could not but wonder at his being sent again to me,
especially as Mr Grenville was so soon to follow.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I was at Court, as usual on that day. M.
de Vergennes asked me if Mr Oswald had not opened
himself further to me? I acquainted him with the sight I
had had of the minute of Council, and of the loose expressions
contained in it, of what was in contemplation.
He seemed to think it odd, that he had brought nothing
more explicit. I supposed Mr Grenville might be better
furnished. The next morning I wrote the following letter
to Mr Adams.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 8th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"Mr Oswald, whom I mentioned in a former letter,
which I find you have received, is returned, and brought
me another letter from Lord Shelburne, of which the
above is a copy. It says Mr Oswald is instructed to communicate
to me his Lordship's thoughts. He is, however,
very sparing of such communication. All I have got from
him is, that the Ministry have in contemplation the allowing
independence to America, on condition of Britain being
put again into the state she was left in by the peace of
1763, which I suppose means being put again in the possession
of the islands, which France has taken from her.
This seems to me a proposition of selling to us a thing,
that was already our own, and making France pay the
price they are pleased to ask for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>"Mr Grenville, who is sent by Mr Fox, is expected here
daily. Mr Oswald tells me, that Mr Laurens will soon be
here also. Yours of the 2d instant is just come to hand.
I shall write to you on this affair hereafter, by the Court
couriers, for I am certain, that your letters to me are
opened at the Post Office, either here or in Holland, and
I suppose that mine to you are treated in the same manner.
I enclose the cover of your last, that you may see the seal.
With great respect, I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>I had but just sent away this letter, when Mr Oswald
came in, bringing with him Mr Grenville, who was just arrived.
He gave me the following letter from Mr Secretary
Fox.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>CHARLES J. FOX TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
St James's, May 1st, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"Though Mr Oswald will, no doubt, have informed you
of the nature of Mr Grenville's commission, yet I cannot
refrain from making use of the opportunity that his going
offers me, to assure you of the esteem and respect, which
I have borne to your character, and to beg you to believe,
that no change in my situation has made any in those
ardent wishes for reconciliation, which I have invariably felt
from the very beginning of this unhappy contest.</p>

<p>"Mr Grenville is fully acquainted with my sentiments
upon this subject, and with the sanguine hopes, which I
have conceived, that those with whom we are contending
are too reasonable to continue a contest, which has no longer
any object, either real or even imaginary. I know your
liberality of mind too well to be afraid, lest any prejudices
against Mr Grenville's <em>name</em> may prevent you from esteeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
those excellent qualities of heart and head,
which belong to him, or from giving the fullest credit to the sincerity
of his wishes for peace, in which no man in either
country goes beyond him. I am, with great truth and regard, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
C. J. FOX."
</p>

<p>I imagined the gentlemen had been at Versailles, as I
supposed Mr Grenville would first have waited on M. de
Vergennes before he called on me. But finding, in conversation,
that he had not, and that he expected me to
introduce him, I immediately wrote to that Minister, acquainting
him, that Mr Grenville was arrived, and desired
to know when his Excellency would think fit to receive
him, and I sent an express with my letter.</p>

<p>I then entered into conversation with him on the subject
of his mission, Mr Fox having referred me to him,
as being fully acquainted with his sentiments. He said that peace
was really wished for by everybody, if it could be obtained
on reasonable terms, and as the idea of subjugating
America was given up, and both France and America had
thereby obtained what they had in view originally,
it was hoped, that there now remained no obstacle to a pacification.
That England was willing to treat of a general
peace with all the powers at war against her,
and that the treaty should be at Paris.</p>

<p>I did not press him much for further particulars, supposing
they were reserved for our interview with M.
de Vergennes. The gentlemen did me the honor of staying
to dinner with me, on the supposition, which I urged, that
my express might be back before we parted. This gave
me an opportunity of a good deal of general conversation
with Mr Grenville, who appeared to me a sensible, judicious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
intelligent, good tempered, and well instructed
young man, answering well the character Mr Fox had
given me of him.</p>

<p>They left me, however, about six o'clock, and my
messenger did not return till near nine. He brought me
the answer of the Count de Vergennes, that he was glad
to hear of Mr Grenville's arrival, and would be ready to
receive us tomorrow, at half past ten or eleven o'clock. I
immediately enclosed his note in one to Mr Grenville, requesting
him to be with me at Passy by eight, that we
might have time to breakfast before we set out. I have
preserved no copy of these three last mentioned notes, or I
should have inserted them, as I think that though they
seem of almost too trifling a nature, they serve usefully
sometimes to settle dates, authenticate facts, and show
something of the turn and manner of thinking of the writers
on particular occasions. The answer I received was as
follows.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>"Mr Grenville presents his compliments to Mr Franklin,
and will certainly do himself the honor of waiting upon
Mr Franklin tomorrow morning at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Rue de Richelieu, Wednesday night."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We set out accordingly the next morning in my coach,
and arrived punctually at Count de Vergennes', who received
Mr Grenville in the most cordial manner, on account
of the acquaintance and friendship that had formerly
subsisted between his uncle and the Count de Vergennes,
when they were ambassadors together at Constantinople.</p>

<p>After some little agreeable conversation, Mr Grenville
presented his letters from Mr Secretary Fox, and, I think,
from the Duke of Richmond. When these were read, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
subject of peace was entered upon. What my memory
retains of the discourse amounts to little more than this,
that after mutual declarations of the good dispositions of
the two Courts, Mr Grenville having intimated that in case
England gave America independence, France, it was expected,
would restore the conquests she had made of British
islands, receiving back those of Miquelon and St Pierre.
And the original object of the war being obtained, it was
supposed that France would be contented with that. The
Minister seemed to smile at the proposed exchange, and
remarked, the offer of giving independence to America
amounted to little. "America," said he, "does not ask
it of you; there is Mr Franklin, he will answer you as to
that point." "To be sure," I said, "we do not consider
ourselves as under any necessity of bargaining for a thing
that is our own, which we have bought at the expense of
much blood and treasure, and which we are in possession
of." "As to our being satisfied with the original object of
the war," continued he, "look back to the conduct of your
nation in former wars. In the last war, for example, what
was the object? It was the disputed right to some waste
lands on the Ohio and the frontiers of Nova Scotia. Did
you content yourselves with the recovery of those lands?
No, you retained at the peace all Canada, all Louisiana,
all Florida, Grenada, and other West India islands, the
greatest part of the Northern Fisheries, with all your conquests
in Africa and the East Indies." Something being
mentioned of its not being reasonable that a nation, after
making an unprovoked and unsuccessful war upon its
neighbors, should expect to sit down whole, and have
everything restored, which she had lost in such a war,
I think Mr Grenville remarked, the war had been provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
by the encouragement given by France to the Americans
to revolt. On which the Count de Vergennes grew a little
warm, and declared firmly, that the breach was made, and
our independence declared, long before we received the
least encouragement from France; and he defied the
world to give the smallest proof of the contrary. "There
sits," said he, "Mr Franklin, who knows the fact, and can
contradict me if I do not speak the truth."</p>

<p>He repeated to Mr Grenville, what he had before said to
Mr Oswald, respecting the King's intention of treating fairly
and keeping faithfully the conventions he should enter
into, of which disposition he should give at the treaty convincing
proofs by the fidelity and exactitude, with which he
should observe his engagements with his present allies, and
added, that the points which the King had chiefly in view
were <em>justice</em> and <em>dignity</em>; these he could not depart from.
He acquainted Mr Grenville, that he should immediately
write to Spain and Holland, communicate to those Courts
what had passed, and request their answers; that, in the
meantime, he hoped Mr Grenville would find means of
amusing himself agreeably, to which he should be glad to
contribute; that he would communicate what had passed
to the King, and he invited him to come again the next
day.</p>

<p>On our return, Mr Grenville expressed himself as not
quite satisfied with some part of the Count de Vergennes'
discourse, and was thoughtful. He told me that he had
brought two State messengers with him, and perhaps, after
he had had another interview with the Minister, he might
despatch one of them to London. I then requested leave
to answer, by that opportunity, the letters I had received
from Lord Shelburne and Mr Fox, and he kindly promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
to acquaint me in time of the messenger's departure.
He did not ask me to go with him the next day to Versailles,
and I did not offer it.</p>

<p>The coming and going of these gentlemen were observed,
and made much talk at Paris, and the Marquis de Lafayette
having learned something of their business from the
Minister, discoursed with me about it. Agreeably to the
resolutions of Congress, directing me to confer with him,
and take his assistance in our affairs, I communicated to
him what had passed. He told me that during the treaty
at Paris for the last peace, the Duc de Nivernois had
been sent to reside in London, that this Court might,
through him, state what was from time to time transacted
in the light they thought best, to prevent misrepresentations
and misunderstandings. That such an employ would
be extremely agreeable to him on many accounts; that as
he was now an American citizen, spoke both languages,
and was well acquainted with our interests, he believed he
might be useful in it; and that as peace was likely from
appearances to take place, his return to America was
perhaps not so immediately necessary. I liked the idea,
and encouraged his proposing it to the Ministry. He then
wished I would make him acquainted with Messrs Oswald
and Grenville, and for that end proposed meeting them at
breakfast with me, which I promised to contrive if I could,
and endeavor to engage them for Saturday.</p>

<p>Friday morning, the 10th of May, I went to Paris, and
visited Mr Oswald. I found him in the same friendly dispositions,
and very desirous of good, and seeing an end put
to this ruinous war. But I got no further sight as to
the sentiment of Lord Shelburne respecting the terms. I told
him the Marquis de Lafayette would breakfast with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
tomorrow, and as he, Mr Oswald, might have some curiosity
to see a person who had in this war rendered himself
so remarkable, I proposed his doing me the same
honor. He agreed to it cheerfully. I came home intending
to write to Mr Grenville, who I supposed might stay
and dine at Versailles, and therefore did not call on him.
But he was returned, and I found the following note from
him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="open">
Paris, May 10th.
</p>

<p>"Mr Grenville presents his compliments to Mr Franklin;
he proposes sending a courier to England at ten
o'clock tonight, and will give him in charge any letters
Mr Franklin may wish to send by him."</p></blockquote>

<p>I sat down immediately, and wrote the two short letters
following to the Secretaries of State.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO MR SECRETARY FOX.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 10th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I received the letter you did me the honor of writing
to me by Mr Grenville, whom I find to be a sensible, judicious,
and amiable gentleman. The name, I assure you,
does not with me lessen the regard his excellent qualities
inspire. I introduced him as soon as possible to Count
de Vergennes; he will himself give you an account of his
reception. I hope his coming may forward the blessed
work of pacification, in which, for the sake of humanity,
no time should be lost, no reasonable cause as you observe
existing at present for the continuance of this abominable
war. Be assured of my endeavors to put an end to it.</p>

<p>"I am much flattered by the good opinion of a person
I have long highly esteemed, and I hope it will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
lessened by my conduct in the affair, that has given rise to
our correspondence. With great respect, I have the
honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO LORD SHELBURNE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 10th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My Lord,
</p>

<p>"I have received the honor of your Lordship's letter,
dated the 28th past, by Mr Oswald, informing me that he
is sent back to settle with me the preliminaries of time and
place. Paris, as the place, seemed to me yesterday to be
agreed on, between Mr Grenville and M. de Vergennes,
and is perfectly agreeable to me. The time cannot well
be settled till this Court has received answers from Madrid,
and the Hague, and until my colleagues are arrived. I expect
daily Messrs Jay and Laurens. Mr Adams doubts
whether he can be here, but that will not hinder our proceeding.</p>

<p>"It gave me great pleasure to hear Mr Laurens is discharged
entirely from the obligations he had entered into.
I am much obliged by the readiness with which your
Lordship has conferred that favor. Please to accept my
thankful acknowledgments.</p>

<p>"I am happy too, in understanding from your letter, that
transports are actually preparing to convey our prisoners to
America, and that attention will be paid to their accommodation
and good treatment. Those people on their return
will be dispersed through every part of America, and the
accounts they will have to give of any marks of kindness
received by them under the present Ministry, will lessen
much the resentment of their friends against the nation, for
the hardships they suffered under the <em>past</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>"Mr Oswald rests here awhile by my advice, as I think
his presence likely to be useful. With great, and sincere
respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>And I sent them to Mr Grenville with the following note.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr Franklin presents his compliments to Mr Grenville,
and thanks him for the information of his courier's departure,
and his kind offer of forwarding Mr Franklin's letter;
he accepts the favor and encloses two.</p>

<p>"The Marquis De Lafayette and Mr Oswald will do
Mr Franklin the honor of breakfasting with him tomorrow,
between nine and ten o'clock. Mr Franklin will also be
happy to have the company of Mr Grenville if agreeable to
him. He should have waited upon Mr Grenville today
at Paris, but he imagined Mr Grenville was at Versailles.</p>

<p>"Passy, Friday evening, May 10th."</p></blockquote>

<p>To which Mr Grenville sent me this answer.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr Grenville presents his compliments to Mr Franklin,
and will, with great pleasure, do himself the honor of
breakfasting with Mr Franklin tomorrow between nine and
ten o'clock. Mr Grenville was at Versailles today, and
should have been sorry if Mr Franklin should have given
himself the trouble of calling at Paris this morning. The
courier shall certainly take particular care of Mr Franklin's
letters.</p>

<p>"Paris, Friday, May 10th."</p></blockquote>

<p>The gentlemen all met accordingly, had a good deal of
conversation at, and after breakfast, staid till after one
o'clock, and parted much pleased with each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>The Monday following, I called to visit Mr Grenville.
I found with him Mr Oswald, who told me he was just
about returning to London. I was a little surprised at the
suddenness of the resolution he had taken, it being, as he
said, to set out the next morning early. I conceived the
gentleman was engaged in business, so I withdrew, and
went to write a few letters, among which was the following
to Lord Shelburne, being really concerned at the thought
of losing so good a man as Mr Oswald.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO LORD SHELBURNE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 13th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My Lord,
</p>

<p>"I did myself the honor of writing to your Lordship a
few days since, by Mr Grenville's courier, acknowledging
the receipt of yours of the 28th past, by Mr Oswald.</p>

<p>"I then hoped that gentleman would have remained
here some time, but his affairs, it seems, recall him sooner
than he imagined. I hope he will return again, as I esteem
him more, the more I am acquainted with him, and
believe his moderation, prudent counsels, and sound judgment
may contribute much, not only to the speedy conclusion
of a peace, but to the framing such a peace as may
be firm and lasting. With great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>I went in the evening to Mr Oswald's lodging with my
letters, when he informed me his intention was to return
immediately hither from England, and, to make the more
despatch in going and returning, he should leave his carriage
at Calais, as the embarking and debarking of carriages
in the packet boats often occasioned a tide's delay. I did
not inquire the reason of this movement. We had but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
little conversation, for Mr Grenville coming in, I soon after
wished him a good journey and retired, that I might not
interrupt their consultations.</p>

<p>Since his departure, Mr Grenville has made me a
visit; and entering into conversation with me, exactly of
the same tenor with the letters I formerly received from
Mr Hartley, stating suppositions that France might insist
on points totally different from what had been the object
of our alliance, and that, in such case, he should imagine
we were not at all bound to continue the war to obtain
such points for her, &amp;c. I thought I could not give him
a better answer to this kind of discourse, than what I
had given in two letters to Mr Hartley, and, therefore,
calling for those letters, I read them to him. He smiled,
and would have turned the conversation; but I gave a
little more of my sentiments on the general subject of
benefits, obligation, and gratitude. I said I thought people
had often imperfect notions of their duty on those
points, and that a state of obligation was to many so
uneasy a state, that they became ingenious in finding out
reasons and arguments to prove that they had been laid
under no obligation at all, or that they had discharged it,
and they too easily satisfied themselves with such arguments.</p>

<p>To explain clearly my ideas on the subject, I stated a
case. A, a stranger to B, sees him about to be imprisoned
for a debt by a merciless creditor, he lends him
the sum necessary to preserve his liberty. B then becomes
the debtor of A, and, after some time, repays the
money. Has he then discharged the obligation? No. He
has discharged the money debt, but the obligation remains,
and he is a debtor for the kindness of A, in lending him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the sum so seasonably. If B should afterwards find A in
the same circumstances, that he, B, had been in when
A lent him the money, he may then discharge this obligation
or debt of kindness <em>in part</em>, by lending him an equal
sum. <em>In part</em>, I said, and not <em>wholly</em>, because, when A
lent B the money, there had been no prior benefit received
to induce him to it. And, therefore, if A should a second
time need the same assistance, I thought B, if in his
power, was in duty bound to afford it to him.</p>

<p>Mr Grenville conceived that it was carrying gratitude
very far, to apply this doctrine to our situation in respect
to France, who was really the party served and obliged by
our separation from England, as it lessened the power of
her rival and relatively increased her own.</p>

<p>I told him I was so strongly impressed with the kind
assistance afforded us by France in our distress, and the
generous and noble manner in which it was granted without
exacting or stipulating for a single privilege, or particular
advantage to herself in our commerce, or otherwise,
that I could never suffer myself to think of such reasonings
for lessening the obligation, and I hoped, and indeed,
did not doubt but my countrymen were all of the same
sentiments.</p>

<p>Thus he gained nothing of the point he came to push,
we parted, however, in good humor. His conversation is
always polite, and his manner pleasing. As he expressed
a strong desire to discourse with me on the means of a
reconciliation with America, I promised to consider the
subject, and appointed Saturday the first day of June, for
our conversation, when he proposed to call on me. The
same day I received another letter from my old friend, Mr
Hartley. Our former correspondence on the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
peace since the beginning of this year, I have kept by
itself, as it preceded this, was in the time of the old Ministry,
and consisted wholly of letters unmixed, with personal
conversation. This being the first letter from him
under the new Ministry, and as it may be followed by
others, which may relate to the negotiation, I insert it here,
with my answer, and shall continue to insert the future
letters I may receive from him relative to the same subject.</p>


<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, May 3d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>"I write to you only one line, just to inform you, that a
general order is issued by our government for the release
of all the American prisoners everywhere. I have had
this from Lord Shelburne, who informed me, that the order
was not partial or conditional, but general and absolute.
I heartily congratulate you upon this first step
towards <em>sweet reconciliation</em>. I hope other things will
follow. I had a long conversation with Lord Shelburne
relating to America, in which he expressed himself in most
favorable terms. I shall have the honor of seeing and
conversing with you again. But at present, as you know,
certain matters are depending from your side of the water.</p>

<p>"Mr Laurens is entirely at liberty. I see him very frequently,
and when you see him he will tell you many

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 13th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>"I have just received your favor of the 3d instant. I
thank you much for the good news you give me, that 'an
order is issued by your government for the release of all
the American prisoners <em>everywhere</em>, an order not <em>partial</em>
or <em>conditional</em>, but <em>general</em> and <em>absolute</em>.' I rejoice with
you in this step, not only on account of the unhappy captives,
who by it will be set at liberty and restored to their
friends and families, but as I think it will tend greatly towards
a reconciliation, on which alone the hope of a durable
peace can be founded. I am much indebted to your
good brother for a very kind and obliging letter, which
was mislaid when it should have been answered. I beg
you would present to him my thankful acknowledgments
and my very sincere respects. I join with you most
heartily in the prayer that ends your letter, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Da pacem,
Domine, in diebus nostris</i>. I am ever, my friend, yours
most affectionately,</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>Our business standing still at present, till the return of
Mr Oswald, gives me a void, that I may fill up with two or
three circumstances, not at present connected with this
intended treaty, but which serve to show something of
the disposition of Courts who have, or may have a concern
in it.</p>

<p>Mr Jay had written to me, from time to time, of the unaccountable
delays he had met with since his residence at
the Court of Spain, and that he was now no nearer in the
business he had been charged with, than when he first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
arrived. Upon the first coming of Mr Oswald, and the
apparent prospect of a treaty, I wrote to press his coming
hither, and, being a little out of humor with that Court, I
said, they have taken four years to consider whether they
should treat with us, give them forty, and let us mind
our own business; and I sent the letter under cover to
a person at Madrid, who I hoped would open and read
it.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that we have in most instances, hurt our
credit and importance, by sending all over Europe, begging
alliances, and soliciting declarations of our independence.
The nations, perhaps, from thence seemed to
think, that our independence is something they have to
sell, and that we do not offer enough for it. Mr Adams
has succeeded in Holland, owing to their war with England,
and a good deal to the late votes in the Commons
towards a reconciliation, but the Ministers of the other
powers refused, as I hear, to return his visits, because our
independence was not yet acknowledged by their Courts.
I had heard here, by good luck, that the same resolution
was taken by several of them not to return the visits I
should make them (as they supposed) when I was first received
here as Minister Plenipotentiary, and disappointed
their project by visiting none of them. In my private
opinion, the first civility is due from the old resident to the
stranger and new comer. My opinion indeed is good for
nothing against custom, which I should have obeyed, but
for the circumstances, that rendered it more prudent to
avoid disputes and affronts, though at the hazard of being
thought rude or singular.</p>

<p>While I am writing, something ridiculous enough on this
head has happened to me. The Count du Nord, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
is son of the Empress of Russia, arriving at Paris, ordered,
it seems, cards of visit to be sent to all the Foreign
Ministers. One of them, on which was written, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Comte du Nord et le Prince Bariatinski</i>," was brought
to me. It was on Monday evening last. Being at Court
the next day, I inquired of an old Minister, my friend,
what was the etiquette, and whether the Count received
visits. The answer was, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non, on se fait ecrire, voila
tout</i>. This is done by passing the door, and ordering
your name to be written on the porter's book. Accordingly,
on Wednesday I passed the house of Prince Bariatinski,
Ambassador of Russia, where the Count lodged,
and left my name on the list of each. I thought no more
of the matter; but this day, May the 24th, comes the
servant who brought the card in great affliction, saying he
was like to be ruined by his mistake in bringing the card
here, and wishing to obtain from me some paper, of I
know not what kind, for I did not see him. In the afternoon
came my friend, Mr Leroy, who is also a friend of
the Prince's, telling me how much he, the Prince, was
concerned at the accident, that both himself and the Count
had great personal regard for me and my character, but
that our independence not yet being acknowledged by the
Court of Russia, it was impossible for him to permit himself
to make me a visit as Minister. I told M. Leroy it
was not my custom to seek such honors, though I was
very sensible of them when conferred upon me; that I
should not have voluntarily intruded a visit, and that, in
this case, I had only done what I was informed the etiquette
required of me, but if it would be attended with any
inconvenience to Prince Bariatinski, whom I much
esteemed and respected, I thought the remedy was easy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
he had only to erase my name out of his book of
visits received, and I would burn their card.</p>

<p>All the Northern Princes are not ashamed of a little
civility committed towards an American. The King of
Denmark, travelling in England under an assumed name,
sent me a card, expressing in strong terms his esteem for
me, and inviting me to dinner with him at St James's.
And the Ambassador from the King of Sweden lately
asked me, whether I had powers to make a treaty of commerce
with their kingdom, for he said his master was
desirous of such a treaty with the United States, had directed
him to ask me the question, and had charged him to
tell me, that it would flatter him greatly to make it with a
person whose character he so much esteemed, &amp;c. Such
compliments might make me a little proud, if we Americans
were not naturally as much so already as the porter,
who being told he had with his burthen jostled the Great
Czar, Peter, then in London, walking the street; "<em>Poh!</em>"
says he, "<em>we are all Czars here</em>."</p>

<p>I did not write by Mr Oswald to Mr Laurens, because,
from some expressions in his last to me, I expected
him here, and I desired Mr Oswald, if he found him
still in London, or met him on the road, to give him
that reason. I am disappointed in my expectation, for
I have now received (May 25th) the following letter from
him.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>HENRY LAURENS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Ostend, May 17th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I had the honor of addressing you on the 30th ult.
by post, a duplicate of which will accompany this, in
order to guard against the effect of a miscarriage in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
first instance, and I beg leave to refer you to the contents.</p>

<p>"On the 10th current and no sooner, your very
obliging favor of the 20th preceding reached me in London.
Being then on the point of leaving that place, I
deferred a reply until my arrival on this side. This happened
yesterday, too late to catch the post of the day,
except by a single letter, put into my hands, I believe, by
Dr Price, which I sent forward.</p>

<p>"I sincerely and heartily thank you, Sir, for the cordial
contents of your last letter; but, from the most mature reflection,
and taking into consideration my present very
infirm state of health, I have resolved to decline accepting
the honor intended me by Congress, in the commission for
treating with Great Britain, and I find the less difficulty in
coming to this determination, from a persuasion in my own
mind that my assistance is not essential, and that it was
not the view or expectation of our constituents, that every
one named in the commission should act. I purpose to
repair to, or near Mr Adams, and inquire of him whether
I may yet be serviceable under the commission to which I
had been first appointed, that for borrowing money for the
use of the United States; if he speaks in the affirmative,
I shall, though much against my own grain, as is well known
at our little Court, proceed in the mission with diligence
and fidelity; otherwise, I shall take a convenient opportunity
of returning to give an account there, of having in the
course of two years and upwards done nothing, excepting
only the making a great number of rebels in the enemy's
country, and reconciling thousands to the doctrine of absolute
and unlimited independence; a doctrine, which I
asserted and maintained with as much freedom in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Tower of London, as I ever had done in the State House
at Philadelphia, and having contentedly submitted to the
loss of my estate, and being ready to lay down my life in
support of it, I had the satisfaction of perceiving the
coming of converts every day. I must not, however,
conclude this head without assuring you, that should you
think proper to ask questions respecting American commerce,
or the interest of any particular State, I will answer
with candor and the best judgment I am possessed of, but
of that judgment I sincerely protest I have the utmost
diffidence. God prosper your proceedings in the great
work; you shall be called blessed by all the grateful of
the present generation, and your name will be celebrated
by posterity. I feel myself happy in reflecting, that, in the
great outlines of a treaty, our opinions exactly coincide,
that we shall not want the countenance and assistance of
our great and good ally, and that you have so honest a
man as Mr Oswald to deal with for preliminaries. I know
him to be superior to chicanery, and am sure he will not
defile his mind by attempting any dirty thing.</p>

<p>"I entreat you, Sir, to present my humble respects to
M. de Vergennes, and thank his Excellency for his polite
expressions respecting me, and be so good as to say all
that shall appear necessary in excuse for my non-appearance
at his Court.</p>

<p>"Lord Cornwallis called on me the day before I left
London, and was, as you may suppose, very anxious to
know when he might probably hear from me on the subject
of his release; let me, therefore, request your opinion
in answer to what I had the honor of writing in my last
concerning that affair. I wish it may prove satisfactory to
his Lordship, by enabling me, with your consent and concurrence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
to cancel a debt, which does not set easy upon
me, and which cannot with honor to our country remain
unpaid. I think we shall not, it is impossible we should,
incur displeasure by doing an act of common justice, and
our authority may be fairly implied.</p>

<p>"His Lordship declares he has no intention of returning
to America, but desires to be reinstated in his legislative
and military character in his own country, and I am of
opinion, that in the former he will rather be friendly to us
than otherwise. For my own part, if the war continues, I
should not be uneasy if his Lordship were to go to the
Chesapeake again.</p>

<p>"I have a thousand compliments and good wishes to
present to you from friends in England, where, males and
females, I am sure you have at least so many, that your
own remembrance will lead you to individuals of your old
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow I intend to proceed to Brussels, and thence,
probably, to the Hague and Amsterdam; my movements
must, unavoidably, be as slow as water carriage. My
weak under limbs cannot bear continual thumping on the
pavement in the rough machines of this country, and the
feebleness of my pocket will not admit the indulgence of
a more convenient vehicle. I beg, Sir, you will write to
me at the house of Mr Edward Jennings, or under the
protection of any other friend in that city, that will be at
the trouble of finding out a voyager, who is at all times,
and in all places, with the highest esteem and respect,
Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
HENRY LAURENS."
</p>

<p>To the above, I wrote the following answer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO HENRY LAURENS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 25th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I am now honored with yours of the 17th. I had before
received one of the 7th, which remained unanswered,
because from the words in it, 'when I reach the Continent,
which will probably happen in a few days,' I flattered
myself with the pleasure of seeing you here. That
hope is disappointed by your last, in which you tell me you
are determined not to act in the commission for treating
of peace with Great Britain. I regret your taking this
resolution, principally because I am persuaded, that your
assistance must have been of great service to our country.
But I have besides some private or particular reasons, that
relate to myself.</p>

<p>"To encourage me in the arduous task, you kindly tell me
I shall be <em>called blessed, &amp;c.</em> I have never yet known of a
peace made, that did not occasion a great deal of popular
discontent, clamor, and censure on both sides. This is,
perhaps, owing to the usual management of the leaders
and Ministers of the contending nations, who, to keep up
the spirits of their people for continuing the war, generally
represent the state of their own affairs in a better light,
and that of the enemy in a worse, than is consistent with
the truth; hence the populace on each side expect better
terms than can really be obtained, and are apt to ascribe
their disappointment to treachery. Thus the peace of
Utrecht, and that of Aix la Chapelle, were said in England
to have been influenced by French gold, and in
France, by English guineas. Even the last peace, the
most glorious and advantageous for England that ever she
made, was, you may remember, violently decried, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
makers as violently abused. So that the blessing promised
to peace-makers, I fancy, relates to the next world, for in
this they seem to have a greater chance of being cursed.
And, as another text observes, that in '<em>the multitude of
counsellors there is safety</em>,' which I think may mean safety
to the counsellors as well as to the counselled, because if
they commit a fault in counselling, the blame does not fall
upon one or a few, but is divided among many, and the
share of each is so much the lighter, or because when a
number of honest men are concerned, the suspicion of
their being biassed is weaker, as being more improbable;
or, because <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defendit numerus</i>; for all these reasons, but
especially for the support your established character of integrity
would afford me against the attacks of enemies, if
this treaty take place, and I am to act in it, I wish for
your presence, and the presence of as many of the Commissioners
as possible, and I hope you will reconsider and
change your resolution.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, as you have had opportunities of conversing
with the new Ministers, and other leading people
in England, and of learning their sentiments relating to
terms of peace, &amp;c. I request you would inform me by
letters of what you think important. Letters from you will
come safer by the Court courier than by the post, and I
desire you would, if you should continue determined not
to act, communicate to me your ideas of the terms to be
insisted on, and the points to be attended to respecting
commerce, fisheries, boundaries, and every other material
circumstance, that may be of importance to all or any of
the United States.</p>

<p>"Lord Shelburne having written to me on the subject of
the wished for peace, I acquainted him in my answer, sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
by our friend, Mr Oswald, that you were one of the Commissioners,
appointed by Congress to treat with Britain,
and that I imagined his Lordship would therefore think
proper to discharge you entirely from the obligations you
entered into, when you were admitted to bail, that you
might be at liberty to act freely in the commission. He
wrote to me in reply, that you were accordingly discharged
immediately. His Lordship mentioned nothing of any
exchange being expected for you, nevertheless I honor
your sensibility on the point, and your concern for the
credit of America, that she should not be outdone in generosity
by Great Britain, and will cheerfully join with you
in any act, that you may think proper, to discharge in return
the parole of Lord Cornwallis, as far as in our power
may lie; but we have no express authority for that purpose,
and the Congress may possibly, in the meantime,
have made some other arrangement relative to his exchange.
I conceive, that our acts should contain a clause,
reserving to Congress the final approbation or disallowance
of the proceeding; and I have some doubt whether Lord
Cornwallis will think himself well freed of his engagements,
and at liberty to exercise his military employments,
by virtue of any concession in his favor made by persons,
who are not vested with authority for that purpose. So that,
on the whole, perhaps the best and surest way will be our
writing immediately to Congress, and strongly recommending
the measure. However, I will do what you shall
think best.</p>

<p>"I heartily wish you success in any endeavors you may
use in Holland for raising a loan of money. We have
pressed rather too hard on this Count, and we still want
more than they can conveniently spare us; but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
sorry, that too scrupulous regard to our wants and difficulties
should induce you, under the present infirmity of your
lower limbs, to deny yourself the necessary comfort of an
easy carriage, rather than make any use of the public assistance,
when the public must be much in your debt. I
beg you would get over that difficulty, and take of me
what you may have occasion for.</p>

<p>"The letter you forwarded to me was from America's
constant friend, the good Bishop of St Asaph. He
speaks of you in terms of the highest esteem and respect.</p>

<p>"Mr Oswald has gone back again to London, but
intended to return again immediately. Mr Grenville remains
here, and has received power to treat, but no further
steps can be taken till Spain and Holland have empowered
Ministers for the same purpose.</p>

<p>"I shall inform you and Mr Adams, (if he does not
come) of the proceeding from time to time, and request
your counsel in cases of any difficulty. I hope you will
not think of hazarding a return to America before a peace,
if we find any hopes of its being soon obtained; and
that if you do not find you can be useful in the manner
you wish, in Holland, you will make me happy by your
company and counsel here. With great and sincere esteem,
&amp;c.</p>

</p>

<p>May the 26th, I received the following letters and papers
from Mr Hartley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>[One of these letters is dated May 1st, which, together
with a paper called the <cite>Breviate</cite>, is printed above, pp. <a href="#Page_343">343</a>, <a href="#Page_351">351</a>.]</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, May 13th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My dear friend,
</p>

<p>"I wrote you a long letter dated May 1st, 1782, by Mr
Laurens, who left London on Saturday last, but I will add
a few lines now by a conveyance, which I believe will
overtake him, just to tell you two or three things, which I
believe I omitted in my last. Perhaps they may not be of
any consequence, but as they relate to my own conduct, I
could wish to have you understand them.</p>

<p>"After several conferences with the late Ministry, I gave
in the paper, called the <cite>Breviate</cite>, on the 7th of February,
but I never received any answer from them. They resigned
on the 20th of March. Upon the accession of the
new Ministry, I heard nothing from them upon the subject,
nor indeed did I apply to them. I did not know whether
that paper would not come into their hands by succession,
and I doubted whether it might not be more proper
for me to wait till I heard from them. While I remained
doubtful about this, I received your letters, which determined
me to go to Lord Shelburne. This was about the
beginning of the present month. I communicated to him
some extracts, such as those about the prisoners, &amp;c. and
likewise the whole of your letter of April 13th, containing
the offer of the late Ministry, the King of France's answer,
together with your reflections in the conclusion respecting
peace. As you had given me a general permission, I left
with him a copy of the whole letter.</p>

<p>"Upon the occasion of this interview, Lord Shelburne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
told me that he had made much inquiry in the offices for
the correspondence and papers, which had passed between
the late Ministry and me, but that he could not meet with
them. He expressed a regret, that he had not conversed
with me at an earlier day, with many civilities of that kind.
In short, I had been backward to intrude myself, and he
expressed regret that he had not sent for me.</p>

<p>"Upon this opening on his part, I stated to him the substance
of what passed between the late Ministry and myself,
and I left a copy of the <cite>Breviate</cite> with him. He gave
me a very attentive audience, and I took that opportunity
of stating my sentiments to him, as far as I could, upon
every view of the question. Upon his expressing his regret
that he had not seen me sooner, I told him that I
always had been, and always should be, most ready to give
any assistance in my power towards the work of peace. I
say the same to you.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that there is any difference of sentiment
between you and me, <em>personally</em>, in our own minds
upon independence, &amp;c. &amp;.c. But we belong to different
communities, and the right of judgment, and of consent
and dissent, is vested in the community. Divide independence
into six millions of shares, and you should have
been heartily <em>welcome</em> to <em>my</em> share from the beginning of
the war. Divide Canada into six millions of shares, I
could find a better method of disposing of <em>my</em> share, than,
by offering it to France, to abandon America. Divide the
rock of Gibraltar into six millions of pieces, I can only
answer for one portion. Let Reason and Justice decide
in any such case, as universal umpires between contending
parties, and those who wish well to the permanent peace
of mankind, will not refuse to give and to receive equal
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>"I agree with you, that the equitable and the philosophical
principles of politics can alone form a solid foundation
of permanent peace; and the contraries to them, though
highly patronized by nations themselves, and their Ministers,
are no better than vulgar errors; but nations are
slow to convictions from the personal arguments of individuals.
'They are jealous in honor, seeking the <em>bubble
reputation</em> even in the cannon's mouth.' But until a confirmed
millennium, founded upon wiser principles, shall be
generally established, the <em>reputation</em> of nations is not merely
a <em>bubble</em>. It forms their real security.</p>

<p>"To apply all this, in one word, let all nations agree, with
one accord, to beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning hooks, or give me wooden walls
to Great Britain! I have nothing further to add. My
reason for writing this, was just to communicate to you in
what position I had delivered over my conferences and
arguments with the late Ministry into the hands of the
present. And I will conclude with your own words, may
God send us all more wisdom. I am ever, most affectionately,
yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
D. HARTLEY."
</p>

<p>"<em>P. S. May 17th, 1782.</em> Since writing the above, I
have likewise left a copy of the enclosed preliminaries
with Lord Shelburne."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>PRELIMINARIES.</h3>

<p class="head">
May, 1782.
</p>

<p>"1. That the British troops shall be withdrawn from the
Thirteen Provinces of North America, and a truce made
between Great Britain and the said Provinces, for &mdash;&mdash;
years. (Suppose ten or twenty years.)</p>

<p>"2. That a negotiation for peace shall <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> be
opened between Great Britain and the allies of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>"3. If the proposed negotiation between Great Britain
and the allies of America should not succeed so far as to
produce peace, but that war should continue between the
said parties, that America should act, and be treated as a
neutral nation.</p>

<p>"4. That whenever peace shall take place between
Great Britain and the allies of America, the truce between
Great Britain and America shall be converted into a perpetual
peace, the independence of America shall be admitted
and guarantied by Great Britain, and a commercial
treaty settled between them.</p>

<p>"5. That these propositions shall be made to the Court
of France, for communication to the American Commissioners,
and for an answer to the Court of Great Britain."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The same day Mr Grenville visited me. He acquainted
me, that his courier was returned, and had brought
him full powers in form to treat for a peace <em>with France
and her allies</em>. That he had been at Versailles, and had
shown his power to M. de Vergennes, and left a copy with
him. That he had also a letter of credence, which he
was not to deliver till France should think fit to send a
Minister of the same kind to London; that M. de Vergennes
had told him, that he would lay it before the King,
and had desired to see him again on Wednesday. That
Mr Oswald had arrived in London, about an hour before
the courier came away. That Mr Fox in his letter had
charged him to thank me for that which I had written, and
to tell me, that he hoped I would never forget, that he
and I were of the same country.</p>

<p>I answered, that I should always esteem it an honor to
be owned as a countryman of Mr Fox. He had requested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
me at our last interview, that if I saw no impropriety in
doing it, I would favor him with a sight of the treaty of
alliance between France and America. I acquainted him
that it was printed, but that if he could not readily meet
with a copy, I would have one written for him. And as
he had not been able to find one, I this day gave it to
him.</p>

<p>He lent me a London gazette, containing Admiral
Rodney's account of his victory over M. de Grasse, and
the accounts of other successes in the East Indies, assuring
me, however, that these events made not the least change
in the sincere desire of his Court to treat for peace.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Marquis de Lafayette called upon
me. I acquainted him with what Mr Grenville had told
me respecting the credential letter, and the expectation
that a person on the part of this Court would be sent to
London with a commission similar to his. The Marquis
told me he was on his way to Versailles, and should see
M. de Vergennes. We concluded, that it would now be
proper for him to make the proposition we had before
talked of, that he should be the person employed in that
service.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 27th, I received a letter from Mr Jay,
dated the 8th, acquainting me, that he had received mine
of the 21st and 22d past, and had concluded to set out for
Paris about the 19th, so that he may be expected in a
few days.</p>

<p>I dined this day with Count d'Estaing, and a number of
brave marine officers, that he had invited. We were all
a little dejected with the news. I mentioned, by way of
encouragement, the observation of the Turkish bashaw,
who was taken with his fleet at Lepanto, by the Venetians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
"Ships," says he, "are like my master's beard, you may
cut it, but it will grow again. He has cut off from your
government all the Morea, which is like a limb, which you
will never recover." And his words proved true.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I dined at Versailles with some friends, so
was not at home when the Marquis de Lafayette called to
acquaint me, that M. de Vergennes informed him, that the
full power received by Mr Grenville from London, and
communicated by him, related to France only. The
Marquis left for me this information, which I could not understand.
On Wednesday I was at Court, and saw the
copy of the power. It appeared full with regard to treating
with France, but mentioned not a word of her allies.
And, as M. de Vergennes had explicitly and constantly,
from the beginning, declared to the several messengers, Mr
Forth, Mr Oswald, and Mr Grenville, that France could
only treat in concert with her allies, and it had in consequence
been declared on the part of the British Ministry,
that they consented to treat for a general peace, and at
Paris, the sending this partial power seemed to be insidious,
and a mere invention to occasion delay, the late disasters
to the French fleet having probably given the Court
of England fresh courage and other views.</p>

<p>M. de Vergennes said he should see Mr Grenville on
Thursday, and would speak his mind to him, on the subject
very plainly. "They want," said he, "to treat with us
for you, but this the King will not agree to. He thinks it
not consistent with the dignity of your state. You will
treat for yourselves; and every one of the powers at war
with England will make its own treaty. All that is necessary
for our common security is, that the treaties go hand
in hand, and are signed all on the same day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>Prince Bariatinski, the Russian Ambassador, was particularly
civil to me this day at Court, apologised for what
passed relating to the visit, expressed himself extremely
sensible of my friendship in covering the affair, which
might have occasioned to him very disagreeable consequences,
&amp;c. The Count du Nord came to M. de Vergennes,
while we were drinking coffee, after dinner. He
appears lively and active, with a sensible, spirited countenance.
There was an opera at night for his entertainment.
The house being richly finished with abundance of carving
and gilding, well illuminated with wax tapers, and the company
all superbly dressed, many of the men in cloth of
tissue, and the ladies sparkling with diamonds, formed
altogether the most splendid spectacle my eyes ever beheld.</p>

<p>I had some little conference today with M. M. Berkenrode,
Vanderpierre and Boeris, the Ambassador of Holland
and the agents of the Dutch East India Company. They
informed me, that the second letter of Mr Fox to the mediating
Minister of Russia, proposing a separate peace with
Holland, made no more impression than the first, and no
peace would be made but in concurrence with France.</p>

<p>The Swedish Minister told me he expected orders from
his Court relative to a treaty, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I had, at our last interview, given Mr Grenville a rendezvous
for Saturday morning, and having some other engagements
for Thursday and Friday, though I wish to
speak with him on the subject of his power, I did not go
to him, but waited his coming to me on Saturday. On
Friday, May 31st, Mr Oswald called on me, being just
returned, and brought me the following letters from Lord
Shelburne, the first of which had been written before his
arrival.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<h3>LORD SHELBURNE TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">Whitehall, May 28th, 1782.
</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I am honored with your letter of the 10th instant, and
am very glad to find that the conduct, which the King has
empowered me to observe towards Mr Laurens, and the
American prisoners, has given you pleasure. I have signified
to Mr Oswald his Majesty's pleasure, that he shall continue
at Paris till he receives orders from hence to return.
In the present state of this business, there is nothing for me
to add, but my sincere wishes for a happy issue, and to
repeat my assurances, that nothing shall be wanting on my
part which can contribute to it. I have the honor to be,
with very great regard,</p>

<h3>LORD SHELBURNE TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Whitehall, May 29th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I have the honor to receive your letter of the 13th of
May, by Mr Oswald. It gives me great pleasure to find
my opinion of the moderation, prudence, and judgment of
that gentleman confirmed by your concurrence. For I
am glad to assure you, that we likewise concur in hoping
that those qualities may enable him to contribute to the
speedy conclusion of a peace, and such a peace as may
be firm and long lasting. In that hope he has the King's
orders to return immediately to Paris, and you will find
him, I trust, properly instructed to co-operate in so desirable
an object. I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
SHELBURNE."
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>I had not then time to converse much with Mr Oswald,
and he promised to come and breakfast with me on Monday.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, June 5th.</em> Mr Grenville came, according to
appointment. Our conversation began by my acquainting
him that I had seen the Count de Vergennes, and had
perused the copy left with him of the power to treat.
That after what he, Mr Grenville, told me of its being to
treat with France <em>and her allies</em>, I was a little surprised to
find in it no mention of the allies, and that it was only to
treat with the King of France and his Ministers; that, at
Versailles, there was some suspicion of its being intended
to occasion delay, the professed desire of a speedy peace
being, perhaps, abated in the British Court since its late
successes; but that I imagined the words relating to the
allies might have been accidentally omitted in transcribing,
or that, perhaps, he had a special power to treat with us
distinct from the other. He answered, that the copy was
right, and that he had no such power in form, but that his
instructions were full to that purpose, and that he was sure
the Ministers had no desire of delay, nor any of excluding
us from the treaty, since the greatest part of those instructions
related to treating with me. That, to convince me
of this sincerity of his Court respecting us, he would acquaint
me with one of his instructions, though, perhaps, the
doing it now was premature, and therefore a little inconsistent
with the character of a politician, but he had that confidence
in me that he should not hesitate to inform me,
(though he wished that at present it should go no further,)
<em>he was instructed to acknowledge the independence
of America, previous to the commencement of the treaty</em>.
And he said he could only account for the omission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
America in the <small>POWER</small>, by supposing that it was an old
official form copied from that given to Mr Stanley, when
he came over hither before the last peace. Mr Grenville
added that he had, immediately after his interview with
the Count de Vergennes, despatched a courier to London,
and hoped, that with his return the difficulty would be removed.
That he was perfectly assured their late success
had made no change in the disposition of his Court to
peace, and that he had more reason than the Count de
Vergennes to complain of delays, since five days were
spent before he could obtain a passport for his courier, and
then it was not to go and return by way of Calais, but to
go by Ostend, which would occasion a delay of five days
longer. Mr Grenville then spoke much of the high opinion
the present Ministry had of me, and their great esteem
for me, their desire of a perfect reconciliation between the
two countries, and the firm and general belief in England,
that no man was so capable as myself of proposing the
proper means of bringing about such a reconciliation, adding
that if the old Ministers had formerly been too little
attentive to my counsels, the present were very differently
disposed, and he hoped that in treating with them, I would
totally forget their predecessors.</p>

<p>The time has been when such flattering language, as
from great men, might have made me vainer, and had
more effect on my conduct, than it can at present, when I
find myself so near the end of life as to esteem lightly all
personal interests and concerns, except that of maintaining
to the last, and leaving behind me the tolerably good character
I have hitherto supported.</p>

<p>Mr Grenville then discoursed of our resolution not to
treat without our allies. This, says he, can only properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
relate to France, with whom you have a treaty of alliance,
but you have none with Spain, you have none with Holland.
If Spain and Holland, and even if France should
insist on unreasonable terms of advantage to themselves,
after you have obtained all you want, and are satisfied, can
it be right that America should be dragged on in a war for
their interest only? He stated this matter in various lights
and pressed it earnestly. I resolved, from various reasons,
to evade the discussion, therefore answered, that the intended
treaty not being yet begun, it appeared unnecessary
to enter at present into considerations of that kind. The
preliminaries being once settled and the treaty commenced,
if any of the other powers should make extravagant demands
on England, and insist on our continuing the war
till those were complied with, it would then be time enough
to consider what our obligations were, and how far they
extended. The first thing necessary was for him to procure
the full powers, the next for us to assemble the plenipotentiaries
of all the belligerent parties, and then propositions
might be mutually made, received, considered,
answered, or agreed to. In the meantime I would just
mention to him, that though we were yet under no obligations
to Spain by treaty, we were under obligations of gratitude
for the assistance she had afforded us; and as Mr Adams
had some weeks since commenced a treaty in Holland, the
terms of which I was not yet acquainted with, I knew not
but that we might have already some alliance and obligations
contracted there. And perhaps we ought, however, to
have some consideration for Holland on this account, that
it was in vengeance for the friendly disposition shown by
some of her people to make a treaty of commerce with us,
that England had declared the war against her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>He said it would be hard upon England, if having given
reasonable satisfaction to one or two of her enemies, she
could not have peace with those till she had complied with
whatever the others might demand, however unreasonable,
for so she might be obliged to pay for every article four
fold. I observed, that when she made her propositions,
the more advantageous they were to each, the more it
would be the interest of each to prevail with the others to
accept those offered to them. We then spoke of the reconciliation,
but his full power not being yet come I chose
to defer entering upon that subject at present. I told him
I had thoughts of putting down in writing the particulars
that I judged would conduce to that end, and of adding my
reasons, that this required a little time, and I had been hindered
by accidents; which was true, for I had begun to
write, but had postponed it on account of his defective
power to treat. But I promised to finish it as soon as
possible. He pressed me earnestly to do it, saying, an
expression of mine in a former conversation, that there still
remained <em>roots of good will</em> in America towards England,
which if properly taken care of might produce a reconciliation,
had made a great impression on his mind, and given
him infinite pleasure, and he hoped I would not neglect furnishing
him with the information of what would be necessary
to nourish those <em>roots</em>, and could assure me, that my
advice would be greatly regarded.</p>

<p>Mr Grenville had shown me at our last interview a letter
from the Duke of Richmond to him, requesting him to
prevail with me to disengage a Captain McLeod, of the
artillery, from his parole, the Duke's brother, Lord George
Lenox, being appointed to the command of Portsmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
and desiring to have him as his aid-de-camp. I had
promised to consider of it, and this morning I sent him the
following letter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO MR GRENVILLE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, May 31st, 1782.
</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,</p>

<p>"I do not find, that I have any express authority to absolve
a parole given by an English officer in America, but
desirous of complying with a request of the Duke of Richmond,
as far as may be in my power, and being confident,
that the Congress will be pleased with whatever may
oblige a personage they so much respect, I do hereby consent,
that Captain McLeod serve in his military capacity
in England only, till the pleasure of the Congress is known,
to whom I will write immediately, and who, I make no
doubt, will discharge him entirely. I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>America had been constantly befriended in Parliament
by the Duke of Richmond, and I believed the Congress
would not be displeased, that this opportunity was taken
of obliging him, and that they would by their approbation
supply the deficiency of my power. Besides, I could not
well refuse it, after what had passed between Mr Laurens
and me, and what I had promised to do for that gentleman.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, June 2d.</em> The Marquis de Lafayette called
and dined with me. He is uneasy about the delay, as
he cannot resolve concerning his voyage to America, till
some certainty appears of there being a treaty or no treaty.
This day I wrote the following letter to Mr Adams.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 2d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"Since mine of May 8th, I have not had anything material
to communicate to your Excellency. Mr Grenville
indeed arrived just after I had despatched that letter, and
I introduced him to M. de Vergennes, but, as his mission
seemed only a repetition of that by Mr Oswald, the same
declaration of the King of England's sincere desire of
peace, and willingness to treat at Paris, which were answered
by the same declarations of the good dispositions of
this Court, and that it could not treat without the concurrence
of its allies, I omitted writing till something should
be produced from a kind of agreement, that M. de Vergennes
would acquaint Spain and Holland with the overture,
and Mr Grenville would write for full powers to treat,
and make propositions; nothing of importance being in the
meantime to be transacted.</p>

<p>"Mr Grenville accordingly despatched a messenger for
London, who returned in about twelve days. Mr Grenville
called on me, after having been at Versailles, and acquainted
me that he had received the power, and had left
a copy of it with M. de Vergennes, and that he was thereby
authorised to treat with France and her <em>allies</em>. The
next time I went to Versailles, I desired to see that copy,
and was surprised to find in it no mention of the allies of
France, or any one of them, and, on speaking with M. de
Vergennes about it, I found he began to look upon the
whole as a piece of artifice to amuse us, and gain time;
since he had uniformly declared to every agent who had
appeared there, viz. to Forth, Oswald, and Grenville, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
the King would not treat without the concurrence of his
allies, and yet England had given a power to treat with
France only, which showed she did not intend to treat at
all, but meant to continue the war.</p>

<p>"I had not till yesterday an opportunity of talking with
Mr Grenville on the subject, and expressing my wonder,
that, after what he told me, there should be no mention
made of our States in his commission, he could not explain
this to my satisfaction, but said, he believed the
omission was occasioned by their copying an old commission
given to Mr Stanley at the last treaty of peace, for he
was sure the intention was, that he should treat with us,
his instructions being fully to that purpose. I acquainted
him, that I thought a special commission was necessary,
without which we could not treat with him. I imagine,
that there is a reluctance in their king to take this first
step, as the giving such a commission would itself be a
kind of acknowledgment of our independence. Their late
success against Count de Grasse may also have given them
hopes, that by delay and more successes they may make
that acknowledgment and a peace less necessary.</p>

<p>"Mr Grenville has written to his Court for further instructions.
We shall see what the return of his courier will
produce. If full power to treat with each of the powers
at war against England does not appear, I imagine
the negotiation will be broken off. Mr Grenville, in his
conversation with me, insists much on our being under no
engagements not to make a peace without Holland. I
have answered him, that I know not but that you may have
entered into some, and if there should be none, a general
pacification, made at the same time, would be best for us
all, and that I believe neither Holland nor we could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
prevailed on to abandon our friends. What happens further
shall be immediately communicated.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to present my respects to Mr Laurens, to
whom I wrote some days since. Mr Jay, I suppose, is on
his way hither. With great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On Monday the 3d, Mr Oswald came according to appointment.
He told me he had seen and had conversations
with Lord Shelburne, Lord Rockingham, and Mr
Fox. That their desire of peace continued uniformly the
same, though he thought some of them were a little too
much elated with the late victory in the West Indies, and
when observing his coolness, they asked him if he did not
think it a very good thing; yes, said he, if you do not
rate it too high. He went on with the utmost frankness to
tell me, that the peace was absolutely necessary for them.
That the nation had been foolishly involved in four wars,
and could no longer raise money to carry them on, so
that if they continued, it would be absolutely necessary for
them to stop payment of the interest money on the funds,
which would ruin their future credit. He spoke of stopping
on all sums above £1000, and continuing to pay on
those below, because the great sums belonged to the rich,
who could better bear the delay of their interest, and the
smaller sums to poorer persons, who would be more hurt,
and make more clamor, and that the rich might be quieted
by promising them interest upon their interest. All this
looked as if the matter had been seriously thought on.</p>

<p>Mr Oswald has an air of great simplicity and honesty,
yet I could hardly take this to be merely a weak confession
of their deplorable state, and thought it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
rather intended as a kind of intimidation, by showing us
that they had still that resource in their power, which he
said would furnish five millions a year. But, he added,
our enemies may now do what they please with us, <em>they
have the ball at their foot</em>, was his expression, and we
hope they will show their moderation and magnanimity.
He then repeatedly mentioned the great esteem the Ministers
had for me, that they, with all the considerate people
of England, looked to, and depended on me for the
means of extricating the nation from its present desperate
situation; and that, perhaps, no single man had ever in
his hands an opportunity of doing so much good as I had
at this present time, with much more to that purpose. He
then showed me a letter to him from Lord Shelburne,
partly, I suppose, that I might see his Lordship's opinion
of me, which, as it has some relation to the negotiation, is
here inserted. He left it with me, requesting that I
would communicate it to Mr Walpole.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>LORD SHELBURNE TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="head">
Whitehall, May 21st, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"It has reached me, that Mr Walpole esteems himself
much injured by your going to Paris, and that he conceives
it was a measure of mine, intended to take the
present negotiation with the Court of France out of his
hands, which he conceives to have been previously commenced
through his channel, by Mr Fox. I must desire
that you will have the goodness to call upon Mr Walpole,
and explain to him distinctly, how very little foundation
there is for so unjust a suspicion, as I knew of no such
intercourse. Mr Fox declares, he considered what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
passed between him and Mr Walpole, of a mere private
nature, not sufficiently material to mention to the King or
the cabinet, and will write to Mr Walpole to explain this
distinctly to him.</p>

<p>"But if you find the least suspicion of this kind has
reached Dr Franklin, or the Count de Vergennes, I
desire this matter may be clearly explained to both. I
have too much friendship for Dr Franklin, and too much
respect for the character of the Count de Vergennes,
with which I am perfectly acquainted, to be so indifferent
to the good opinion of either, as to suffer them to
believe me capable of an intrigue, where I have both
professed and observed a direct opposite course of conduct.
In truth, I hold it in such perfect contempt, that,
however proud I may be to serve the King in my present
situation, or in any other, and however anxious I may be
to serve my country, I should not hesitate a moment about
retiring from any situation which required such services.
But I must do the King the justice to say, that his Majesty
abhors them, and I need not tell you that it is my
fixed principle, that no country in any moment can be advantaged
by them. I am, with great truth and regard, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
SHELBURNE."
</p>

<p>In speaking further of the Ministry's opinion of the
great service it might be in my power to render, Mr
Oswald said, he had told them in one of his conversations,
that nothing was to be expected of me but consistency,
nothing unsuitable to my character, or inconsistent
with my duty to my country. I did not ask him the particular
occasion of his saying this, but thought it looked
a little as if something inconsistent with my duty had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
talked of or proposed. Mr Oswald also gave me a copy
of a paper of memorandums, written by Lord Shelburne,
viz.</p>

<blockquote><p>"1. That I am ready to correspond more particularly
with Dr Franklin, if wished.</p>

<p>"2. That the <em>Enabling Act</em> is passing, with the insertion
of Commissioners recommended by Mr Oswald; and, on
our part, Commissioners will be named, or any character
given to Mr Oswald, which Dr Franklin and he may judge
conducive to a final settlement of things between Great
Britain and America; which Dr Franklin very properly
says, requires to be treated in a very different manner
from the peace between Great Britain and France, who
have always been at enmity with each other.</p>

<p>"3. That an establishment for the loyalists must always
be on Mr Oswald's mind, as it is uppermost in Lord Shelburne's,
besides other steps in their favor to influence the
several States to agree to a fair restoration or compensation
for whatever confiscations have taken place.</p>

<p>"4. To give Lord Shelburne's letter about Mr Walpole
to Dr Franklin."</p></blockquote>

<p>On perusing this paper, I recollected that a bill had
been sometime since proposed in Parliament, <em>to enable his
Majesty to conclude a Peace or Truce with the revolted
Provinces in America</em>, which I supposed to be the enabling
bill mentioned, that had hitherto slept, and not having been
passed, was perhaps the true reason why the Colonies
were not mentioned in Mr Grenville's commission. Mr
Oswald thought it likely, and said that the words, "Insertion
of Commissioners, recommended by Mr Oswald,"
related to his advising an express mention in the bill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
the Commissioners appointed by Congress to treat of
peace, instead of the vague denomination of <em>any person or
persons,</em> &amp;c. in the first draft of the bill.</p>

<p>As to the loyalists, I repeated what I had said to him
when first here, that their estates had been confiscated by
the laws made in particular States where the delinquents
had resided, and not by any law of Congress, who, indeed,
had no power, either to make such laws or to repeal them,
or to dispense with them, and, therefore, could give no
power to their Commissioners to treat of a restoration for
those people; that it was an affair appertaining to each
State. That if there were justice in compensating them,
it must be due from England rather than America; but, in
my opinion, England was not under any very great obligations
to them, since it was by their misrepresentations and
bad counsels, she had been drawn into this miserable war.
And that if an account was to be brought against us for
their losses, we should more than balance it by an account
of the ravages they had committed all along the coasts of
America.</p>

<p>Mr Oswald agreed to the reasonableness of all this, and
said he had, before he came away, told the Ministers, that
he thought no recompense to those people was to be expected
from us; that he had also, in consequence of our
former conversation on that subject, given it as his opinion,
that Canada should be given up to the United States, as it
would prevent the occasions of future difference, and, as
the government of such a country was worth nothing, and
of no importance, if they could have there a free commerce;
that the Marquis of Rockingham and Lord Shelburne,
though they spoke reservedly, did not seem very
averse to it, but that Mr Fox appeared to be startled at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
proposition. He was, however, not without hopes that it
would be agreed to.</p>

<p>We now came to another article of the note, viz. "on
our part Commissioners will be named, or any character
given to Mr Oswald, which Dr Franklin and he may judge
conducive to a final settlement of things between Great
Britain and America."</p>

<p>This he said was left entirely to me, for he had no will
in the affair; he did not desire to be further concerned,
than to see it <em>in train</em>, he had no personal views either of
honor or profit. He had now seen and conversed with
Mr Grenville, thought him a very sensible young gentleman,
and very capable of the business; he did not, therefore,
see any further occasion there was for himself; but if
I thought otherwise, and conceived he might be further
useful, he was content to give his time and service, in any
character or manner I should think proper. I said, his
knowledge of America, where he had lived, and with
every part of which, and of its commerce and circumstances
he was well acquainted, made me think, that in persuading
the Ministry to things reasonable relating to that
country, he could speak or write with more weight than
Mr Grenville, and, therefore, I wished him to continue in
the service; and I asked him whether he would like to be
joined in a general commission for treating with all the
powers at war with England, or to have a special commission
to himself for treating with America only. He said
he did not choose to be concerned in treaty with the
foreign powers, for he was not sufficiently a master of their
affairs, or of the French language, which, probably, would
be used in treating; if, therefore, he accepted of any commission,
it should be that of treating with America. I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
him I would write to Lord Shelburne on the subject; but
Mr Grenville having sometime since despatched a courier,
partly on account of the commission, who was not yet returned,
I thought it well to wait a few days, till we could
see what answer he would bring, or what measures were
taken. This he approved of.</p>

<p>The truth is, he appears so good and so reasonable a
man, that, though I have no objection to Mr Grenville, I
should be loth to lose Mr Oswald. He seems to have
nothing at heart but the good of mankind, and putting a
stop to mischief; the other, a young statesman, may be
supposed to have naturally a little ambition of recommending
himself as an able negotiator.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, M. Boeris, of Holland, called on me,
and acquainted me that the answer had not yet been given
to the last memorial from Russia, relating to the mediation;
but it was thought it would be in respectful terms, to
thank her Imperial Majesty for her kind offers, and to
represent the propriety of their connexion with France in
endeavors to obtain a general peace, and that they conceived
it would be still more glorious for her Majesty to
employ her influence in procuring a general, than a particular
pacification. M. Boeris further informed me, that
they were not well satisfied in Holland with the conduct of
the Russian Court, and suspected views of continuing the
war for particular purposes.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, June. 4th.</em> I have received another packet
from Mr Hartley. It consisted of duplicates of former
letters and papers already inserted, and contained nothing
new but the following letter from Colonel Hartley, his
brother.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<h3>W. H. HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Soho Square, May 24th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>"It is with the greatest pleasure I take up my pen to
acknowledge your remembrance of me in yours to my
brother, and to thank you for those expressions of regard
which I can assure you are mutual. My brother has desired
me to copy some letters and papers, by way of
sending you duplicates. I am particularly happy at the
employment, because the greatest object of my parliamentary
life has been to co-operate with him in his endeavors
to put a period to this destructive war, and forward the
blessed work of peace. I hope to see him again in that
situation, where he can so well serve his country with
credit to himself; and while I have the honor of being in
Parliament, my attention will be continued to promote the
effects, which will naturally flow from those principles of
freedom and universal philanthropy you have both so
much supported. While I copy his words, my own feelings
and judgment are truly in unison, and I have but to
add the most ardent wish, that peace and happiness may
crown the honest endeavors towards so desirable an end.</p>

<p>"I am, dear Sir, with the greatest respect and esteem,
yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="signature">
W. H. HARTLEY."
</p>


<p><em>Wednesday, June 5th.</em> Mr Oswald called again to acquaint
me, that Lord Cornwallis, being very anxious to be
discharged from his parole as soon as possible, had sent a
Major Ross hither to solicit it, supposing Mr Laurens might
be here with me. Mr Oswald told me, what I had not
heard before, that Mr Laurens, while prisoner in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
Tower, had proposed obtaining the discharge of Lord
Cornwallis in exchange for himself, and had promised to
use his utmost endeavors to that purpose, in case he was
set at liberty, not doubting of the success. I communicated
to Mr Oswald what had already passed between Mr Laurens
and me, respecting Lord Cornwallis; which appears
in the preceding letters, and told him I should have made
less difficulty about the discharge of his parole, if Mr
Laurens had informed me of his being set at liberty in
consequence of such an offer and promise, and I wished
him to state this in a letter to me, that it might appear for
my justification in what I might, with Mr Laurens, do in
the affair; and that he would procure for me from Major
Ross a copy of the parole, that I might be better acquainted
with the nature of it. He accordingly in the
afternoon sent me the following letter.</p>

<blockquote><p>[See this letter above, p. <a href="#Page_362">362</a>.&mdash;Also the answer, p. <a href="#Page_363">363</a>.]</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Friday, June 7th.</em> Major Ross called upon me, to
thank me for the favorable intentions I had expressed in
my letter to Mr Oswald, respecting Lord Cornwallis, and
to assure me, that his Lordship would forever remember it
with gratitude, &amp;c. I told him it was our duty to alleviate,
as much as we could, the calamities of war; that I expected
letters from Mr Laurens, relating to the affair, after
the receipt of which I would immediately complete it. Or
if I did not hear from Mr Laurens, I would speak to the
Marquis de Lafayette, get his approbation, and finish it
without further delay.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, June 8th.</em> I received some newspapers from
England, in one of which is the following paragraph.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span><cite>From the London Evening Post, of May 30th, 1782.</cite></p>

<p>"If report on the spot speak truth, Mr Grenville, in his
first visit to Dr Franklin, gained a considerable point of
information, as to the powers America had retained for
treating <em>separately</em> with Great Britain, in case her claims,
or demands, were granted.</p>

<p>"The treaty of February 6th, 1778, was made the basis
of this conversation; and by the spirit and meaning of this
treaty, there is no obligation on America not to treat separately
for peace, after she is assured England will grant
her independence, and a free commerce with all the world.</p>

<p>"The <em>first</em> article of that treaty engages America and
France to be bound to each other, as long as <em>circumstances</em>
may require; therefore, the granting America all she asks
of England is breaking the bond, by which the <em>circumstances</em>
may bind America to France.</p>

<p>"The second article says, the meaning and direct end
of the alliance is to insure the freedom and independence
of America. Surely then, when freedom and independence
are allowed by Britain, America may, or may not,
as she chooses, put an end to the present war between
England and America, and leave France to war on
through all her mad projects of reducing the power and
greatness of England, while America feels herself possessed
of what she wishes.</p>

<p>"By the 8th article of the treaty, neither France nor
America can conclude peace without the assent of the
other; and they engage not to lay down their arms, until the
independence of America is acknowledged, but this article
does not exclude America from entering into a separate
treaty for peace with England, and evinces more strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
than the former articles, that America may enter into a
separate treaty with England, when she is convinced that
England has insured to her <em>all that she can reasonably
ask</em>."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I conjecture that this must be an extract from a letter of
Mr Grenville's; but it carries an appearance as if he and I
had agreed in these imaginary discourses, of America's
being at liberty to make peace without France, and whereas
my whole discourse, in the strongest terms, declared our
determinations to the contrary, and the impossibility of our
acting, not only contrary to the treaty, but the duties of
gratitude and honor, of which nothing is mentioned. This
young negotiator seems to value himself on having obtained
from me a copy of the treaty. I gave it him freely, at his
request, it being not so much a secret as he imagined,
having been printed, first in all the American papers soon
after it was made, then at London in Almon's Remembrancer,
which I wonder he did not know; and afterwards
in a collection of the American Constitutions, published by
order of Congress. As such imperfect accounts of our
conversations find their way into the English papers, I must
speak to this gentleman of its impropriety.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, June 9th.</em> Doctor Bancroft being intimately
acquainted with Mr Walpole, I this day gave him Lord
Shelburne's letter to Mr Oswald, requesting he would communicate
it to that gentleman. Doctor Bancroft said it
was believed both Russia and the Emperor wish the continuance
of the war, and aimed at procuring for England a
peace with Holland, that England might be better able to
continue it against France and Spain.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette having proposed to call on me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
today, I kept back the discharge of Lord Cornwallis, which
was written and ready, desiring to have his approbation of it,
as he had in a former conversation advised it. He did not
come, but late in the evening sent me a note, acquainting
me that he had been prevented by accompanying the Great
Duke to the review, but would breakfast with me tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p>This day I received a letter from Mr Dana, dated at
St Petersburgh, April 29th, in which is the following passage.
"We yesterday received the news, that the States-General had,
on the 19th of this month (N. S.) acknowledged
the independence of the United States. This event
gave a shock here, and is not well received, as they at
least profess to have flattered themselves, that the mediation
would have prevented it, and otherwise brought on a
partial peace between Britain and Holland. This resentment,
I believe, will not be productive of any ill consequences
to the Dutch republic." It is true, that while the
war continues, Russia feels a greater demand for the naval
stores, and perhaps at a higher price. But is it possible,
that for such petty interests, mankind can wish to see their
neighbors destroy each other? Or has the project, lately
talked of, some foundation, that Russia and the Emperor
intend driving the Turks out of Europe, and do they therefore
wish to see France and England so weakened, as to
be unable to assist those people?</p>

<p><em>Monday, June 12th.</em> The Marquis de Lafayette did
not come till between eleven and twelve. He brought with
him Major Ross. After breakfast, he told me (Major
Ross being gone into another room) that he had seen Mr
Grenville lately, who asked him when he should go to
America. That he had answered, I have staid here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
longer than I should otherwise have done, that I might see
whether we were to have peace or war, but as I see that
the expectation of peace is a joke, and that you only amuse
us without any real intention of treating, I think to stay no
longer, but set out in a few days. On which Mr Grenville
assured him that it was no joke, that they were very sincere
in their proposal of treating, and four or five days
would convince the Marquis of it.</p>

<p>The Marquis then spoke to me about a request of Major
Ross's in behalf of himself, Lord Chewton, a Lieutenant
Colonel and Lieutenant Haldane, who were aids-de-camp
to Lord Cornwallis, that they too might be set at
liberty with him. I told the Marquis that he was better
acquainted with the custom in such cases than I, and being
himself one of the Generals, to whom their parole had
been given, he had more right to discharge it than I had,
and that if he judged it a thing proper to be done, I wished
him to do it. He went into the bureau, saying he would
write something, which he accordingly did, but it was not
as I expected, a discharge that he was to sign, it was for
me to sign. And the Major not liking that which I had
drawn for Lord Cornwallis, because there was a clause in
it, reserving to Congress the approbation or disallowance
of my act, went away without taking it. Upon which I
the next morning wrote the following to Mr Oswald.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 11th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I did intend to have waited on you this morning to
inquire after your health, and deliver the enclosed paper
relating to the parole of Lord Cornwallis, but being obliged
to go to Versailles, I must postpone my visit till tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>"I do not conceive that I have any authority, in virtue
of my office here, to absolve that parole in any degree; I
have, therefore, endeavored to found it as well as I could
on the express power given me by Congress to exchange
General Burgoyne for Mr Laurens. A reservation is made
of confirmation or disapprobation by Congress, not from
any desire to restrain the entire liberty of that General, but
because I think it decent and my duty to make such reservation,
and that I might otherwise be blamed as assuming
a power not given me, if I undertook to discharge absolutely
a parole given to Congress, without any authority
from them for so doing. With great esteem and respect,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p>I have received no answer from Mr Laurens. The following
is the paper mentioned in the above letter.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Discharge of Lord Cornwallis from his Parole.</em></p>

<p>"The Congress having, by a resolution of the 14th of
June last, empowered me to offer an exchange of General
Burgoyne for the Honorable Henry Laurens, then a prisoner
in the Tower of London, and whose liberty they
much desire to obtain, which exchange, though proposed
by me, according to the said resolution, had not been accepted
or executed, when advice was received, that General
Burgoyne was exchanged in virtue of another agreement.
And Mr Laurens thereupon having proposed
another Lieutenant General, viz, Lord Cornwallis, as an
exchange for himself, promising that if set at liberty, he
would do his utmost to obtain a confirmation of that proposal;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
and Mr Laurens being soon after discharged, and
having since urged me earnestly, in several letters, to join
with him in absolving the parole of that General, which
appears to be a thing just and equitable in itself; and for
the honor therefore of our country I do hereby, as far as
in my power lies, in virtue of the above resolution, or otherwise,
absolve and discharge the parole of Lord Cornwallis,
given by him in Virginia; setting him at entire liberty
to act in his civil or military capacity, until the pleasure of
Congress shall be known, to whom is reserved the confirmation
or disapprobation of this discharge, in case they have
made or shall intend to make a different disposition.</p>

<p>"Given at Passy, this 9th day of June, 1782.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN,<br />
<em>Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States</em><br />
<em>of America to the Court of France.</em>"
</p>

<p>I did not well comprehend the Major's conduct in refusing
this paper. He was come express from London, to
solicit a discharge of Lord Cornwallis's parole. He had
said that his Lordship was very anxious to obtain that discharge,
being unhappy in his present situation. One of his
objections to it was, that his Lordship with such a limited
discharge of his parole could not enter into foreign service.
He declared it was not his Lordship's intention to return
to America. Yet he would not accept the paper, unless
the reservation was omitted. I did not choose to make the
alteration, and so he left it, not well pleased with me.</p>

<p>This day, <em>Tuesday, June 11th</em>, I was at Versailles, and
had a good deal of conversation with M. de Rayneval,
Secretary to the Council. I showed him the letters I had
received by Mr Oswald from Lord Shelburne, and related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
all the consequent conversation I had with Mr Oswald. I
related to him also the conversation I had had with Mr
Grenville. We concluded that the reason of his couriers
not being returned, might be the formalities occasioning
delay in passing the enabling bill. I went down with him to
the cabinet of Count de Vergennes, where all was repeated
and explained. That Minister seemed now to be almost
persuaded, that the English Court was sincere in its declarations
of being desirous of peace. We spoke of all its
attempts to separate us, and of the prudence of our holding
together and treating in concert. I made one remark, that
as they had shown so strong a desire of disuniting us, by
large offers to each particular power, plainly in the view of
dealing more advantageously with the rest, and had reluctantly
agreed to make a general treaty, it was possible, that
after making a peace with all, they might pick out one of
us to make war with separately. Against which project
I thought it would not be amiss, if before the treaties of
peace were signed, we who were at war against England
should enter into another treaty, engaging ourselves, that in
such a case, we should again make it a common cause,
and renew the general war; which he seemed to approve
of. He read Lord Shelburne's letter relating to Mr Walpole,
said that gentleman had attempted to open a negotiation
through the Marquis de Castries, who had told him
he was come to the wrong house, and should go to Count
de Vergennes; but he never had appeared; that he was an
intriguer, knew many people about the Court, and was accustomed
to manage his affairs by hidden and round-about
ways; but, said he, "when people have anything to propose,
that relates to my employment, I think they should come
directly to me; my cabinet is the place where such affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
are to be treated." On the whole he seemed rather pleased
that Mr Walpole had not come to him, appearing not to
like him.</p>

<p>I learnt that Mr Jay had taken leave on the 7th past, of
the Spanish Ministers, in order to come hither, so that he
may be daily expected; but I hear nothing of Mr Laurens
or Mr Adams.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, June 12th</em>. I visited Mr Oswald this
morning. He said he had received the paper I had sent
him, relating to the parole of Lord Cornwallis, and had by
conversing with Major Ross, convinced him of his error in
refusing it; that he saw I had done everything that could
be fairly desired of me, and said everything in the paper
that could give a weight to the temporary discharge, and
tend to prevail with the Congress to confirm and complete
it. Major Ross coming in, made an apology for not having
accepted it at first, declared his perfect satisfaction
with it, and said he was sure Lord Cornwallis would be
very sensible of the favor. He then mentioned the custom
among military people, that in discharging the parole
of a general, that of his aids was discharged at the same
time. I answered, I was a stranger to the customs of the
army, that I had made the most of the authority I had for
exchanging General Burgoyne, by extending it as a foundation
for the exchange of Lord Cornwallis, but that I had
no shadow of authority for going further; that the Marquis
de Lafayette having been present when the parole was
given, and one of the generals who received it, was I
thought more competent to the discharge of it than myself;
and I could do nothing in it. He went then to the Marquis,
who, in the afternoon, sent me the drafts of a limited
discharge, which he should sign, but requested my approbation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of it, of which I made no difficulty, though I observed
he had put into it that it was by my advice. He
appears very prudently cautious of doing anything, that
may seem assuming a power that he is not vested with.</p>

<p><em>Friday, the 14th.</em> M. Boeris called again, wishing to
know if Mr Grenville's courier was returned, and whether
the treaty was like to go on. I could give him no information.
He told me it was intended in Holland, in answer
to the last Russian Memorial, to say, that they could
not now enter into a particular treaty with England, that
they thought it more glorious for her Imperial Majesty to
be the mediatrix in a general treaty, and wished her to
name the place. I said to him, as you tell me their High
Mightinesses are not well satisfied with Russia, and had
rather avoid her mediation, would it not be better to omit
the proposition, at least of her naming the place, especially
as France, England, and America have already agreed
to treat at Paris? He replied, it might be better, but,
says he, we have no politicians among us. I advised him
to write and get that omitted, as I understood if would be
a week before the answer was concluded on. He did not
seem to think his writing would be of much importance.
I have observed, that his colleague, M. Vanderpierre, has
a greater opinion by far of his own influence and consequence.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, June 15th.</em> Mr Oswald came out to breakfast
with me. We afterwards took a walk in the garden,
when he told me, that Mr Grenville's courier returned last
night. That he had received by him a letter from Mrs
Oswald, but not a line from the Ministry, nor had he heard
a word from them since his arrival, nor had he heard of
any news brought by the courier. That he should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
gone to see Mr Grenville this morning, but he had omitted
it, that gentleman being subject to morning headache,
which prevented his rising so early. I said I supposed he
would go to Versailles, and call on me in his return. We
had but little further discourse, having no new subject.</p>

<p>Mr Oswald left me about noon, and soon after Mr
Grenville came, and acquainted me with the return of his
courier, and that he had brought the full powers. That
he, Mr Grenville, had been at Versailles, and left a copy
with Count de Vergennes. That the instrument was in the
same terms with the former, except that after the power to
treat with the King of France, or his Ministers, there was
an addition of words, importing a power to treat with the
Ministers of any other Prince or <em>State</em> whom it might concern.
That Count de Vergennes had at first objected to
these general words, as not being particular enough, but
said he would lay it before the King, and communicate it
to the Ministers of the belligerent powers, and that Mr
Grenville should hear from him on Monday. Mr Grenville
added, that he had further informed Count de Vergennes
of his being now instructed to make a proposition
as a basis for the intended treaty, viz. the peace of 1763.
That the proposition intended to be made under his
first powers, not being then received, was now changed,
and instead of proposing to allow the independence of
America, on condition of England's being put into the situation
she was in at the peace of 1763, he was now authorised
to <em>declare the Independence of America previous to
the treaty</em>, as a voluntary act, and to propose separately as
a basis the treaty of 1763. This also Count de Vergennes
undertook to lay before the King, and communicate to
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>Mr Grenville then said to me, he hoped all difficulties
were now removed, and that we might proceed in the good
work. I asked him, if the enabling bill was passed? He
said, no. It passed the Commons, and had been once
read in the House of Lords, but was not yet completed.
I remarked, that the usual time approached for the prorogation
of Parliament, and possibly this business might be
omitted. He said there was no danger of that, the Parliament
would not rise this year till the middle of July;
the India affairs had put back other business which must
be done, and would require a prolongation of the session
till that time. I then observed to him, that, though we
Americans considered ourselves as a distinct independent
power, or State, yet, as the British Government had always,
hitherto; affected to consider us only as rebellious
subjects, and as the enabling act was not yet passed, I did
not think it could be fairly supposed, that his Court intended
by the general words, <em>any other Prince or State</em>,
to include a people whom they did not allow to be a
State; and that, therefore, I doubted the sufficiency of his
power as to treating with America, though it might be
good as to Spain and Holland. He replied, that he himself
had no doubt of the sufficiency of his power, and was
willing to act upon it. I then desired to have a copy of
the power, which he accordingly promised me.</p>

<p>He would have entered into conversation on the topic
of reconciliation, but I chose still to waive it, till I should
find the negotiation more certainly commenced; and I
showed him the London paper containing the article above
transcribed, that he might see how our conversations were
misrepresented, and how hazardous it must be for me
to make any propositions of the kind at present. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
seemed to treat the newspapers lightly, as of no consequence,
but I observed that before he had finished the
reading of the article, he turned to the beginning of the
paper to see the date, which made me suspect that he
doubted whether it might not have taken its rise from
some of his letters.</p>

<p>When he left me, I went to dine with M. de Chaumont,
who had invited me to meet there Mr Walpole, at his request.
We shook hands, and he observed that it was near
two years since we had seen each other. Then, stepping
aside, he thanked me for having communicated to him
Lord Shelburne's letter to Mr Oswald, thought it odd
that Mr Oswald himself had not spoken to him about it;
said he had received a letter from Mr Fox upon the affair
of St Eustatia, in which there were some general words,
expressing a desire of peace; that he had mentioned this
to the Marquis de Castries, who had referred him to Count
de Vergennes, but he did not think it a sufficient authority
for him to go to that Minister. It was known that he had
business with the Minister of the Marine on the other
affair, and, therefore, his going to him was not taken notice
of; but if he had gone to Count de Vergennes, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, it would have occasioned speculation, and
much discourse; that he had, therefore, avoided it till he
should be authorised, and had written accordingly to Mr
Fox; but that in the meantime, Mr Oswald had been
chosen upon the supposition, that he, Mr Walpole, and I,
were at variance. He spoke of Mr Oswald as an odd
kind of man, but that, indeed, his nation were generally odd
people, &amp;c. We dined pleasantly together with the family,
and parted agreeably, without entering into any particulars
of the business. Count d'Estaing was at this dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
and I met him again in the evening, at Madame Brillon's.
There is at present among the people, much censure of
Count de Grasse's conduct, and a general wish that Count
d'Estaing had the command in America. I avoid meddling,
or even speaking on the subject, as improper for me,
though I much esteem that commander.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, the 16th.</em> I heard nothing from Versailles.
I received a letter from Mr Adams, acquainting me he had
drawn upon me for a quarter's salary, which he hoped
would be the last, as he now found himself in the way of
getting some money there, though not much. But he says
not a word in answer to my late letters on public affairs,
nor have I any line from Mr Laurens, which I wonder at.
I received also a letter from Mr Carmichael, dated June
5th, at Madrid. He speaks of Mr Jay being on his
journey, and supposes he would be with me before that
letter, so that I may expect him daily. We have taken
lodgings for him in Paris.</p>

<p><em>Monday, the 17th.</em> I received a letter from Mr Hodgson,
acquainting me that the American prisoners at Portsmouth,
to the number of three hundred, were all embarked
on board the transports, that each had received
twenty shillings' worth of necessaries at the expense of
government, and went on board in good humor; that
contrary winds had prevented the transports arriving in
time at Plymouth, but that the whole number there now
of our people, amounting to seven hundred, with those
arrived from Ireland, would soon be on their way home.</p>

<p>In the evening the Marquis de Lafayette came to see
me, and said he had seen Count de Vergennes, who was
satisfied with Mr Grenville's powers. He asked me what I
thought of them, and I told him what I had said to Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
Grenville of their imperfection with respect to us. He
agreed in opinion with me. I let him know that I proposed
waiting on Count de Vergennes tomorrow.</p>

<p>He said he had signed the paper relating to Major
Ross's parole, and hoped Congress would not take it
amiss, and added, that in conversation with the Major, he
had asked him why England was so backward to make
propositions? We are afraid, says the Major, of offering
you more than you expect or desire. I find myself in
some perplexity with regard to these two negotiators. Mr
Oswald appears to have been the choice of Lord Shelburne,
Mr Grenville that of Mr Secretary Fox. Lord
Shelburne is said to have lately acquired much of the
King's confidence. Mr Fox calls himself the Minister of
the people, and it is certain, that his popularity is lately
much increased. Lord Shelburne seems to wish to have
the management of the treaty, Mr Fox seems to think it
in his department. I hear that the understanding between
these Ministers is not quite perfect. Mr Grenville is
clever, and seems to feel reason as readily as Mr Oswald,
though not so ready to own it. Mr Oswald appears quite
plain and sincere; I sometimes a little doubt Mr Grenville.
Mr Oswald, an old man, seems now have no desire but
that of being useful in doing good. Mr Grenville, a young
man, naturally desirous of acquiring reputation, seems to
aim at that of being an able negotiator. Mr Oswald does
not solicit to have any share in the business, but, submitting
the matter to Lord Shelburne and me, expresses only his
willingness to serve, if we think he may be useful, and is
equally willing to be excused, if we judge there is no occasion
for him. Mr Grenville seems to think the whole negotiation
committed to him, and to have no idea of Mr Oswald's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
being concerned in it, and is, therefore, willing to extend
the expressions in his commission, so as to make them
comprehend America, and this beyond what I think they
will bear. I imagine we might, however, go on very well
with either of them, though I rather should prefer Oswald,
but I apprehend difficulties if they are both employed,
especially if there is any misunderstanding between their
principals. I must, however, write to Lord Shelburne,
proposing something in consequence of his offer of vesting
Mr Oswald with any commission, which that gentleman
and I should think proper.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, the 18th.</em> I found myself much indisposed
with a sudden and violent cold, attended with a feverishness
and headach. I imagined it to be an effect of the
influenza, a disorder now reigning in various parts of Europe.
This prevented my going to Versailles.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, the 20th.</em> Weather excessively hot, and my
disorder continues, but is lessened, the headach having
left me. I am, however, not yet able to go to Versailles.</p>

<p><em>Friday, the 21st.</em> I received the following note from
the Marquis de Lafayette.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>M. DE LAFAYETTE TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Versailles, Thursday morning, June 20th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"My dear Sir,
</p>

<p>"Agreeably to your desire, I have waited upon the
Count de Vergennes, and said to him what I had in command
from your Excellency. He intends taking the
King's orders this morning, and expects he will be able to
propose to Mr Grenville a meeting for tomorrow, when he
will have time to explain himself respecting France and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
her allies, that he may make an official communication
both to the King and the allied Ministers. What Count
de Vergennes can make out of this conversation will be
communicated by him to your Excellency, in case you are
able to come. In the other case I shall wait upon you tomorrow
evening with every information I can collect. I
have the honor to be, very respectfully, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
LAFAYETTE."
</p>

<p>In the evening the Marquis called upon me, and acquainted
me, that Mr Grenville had been with Count de
Vergennes, but could not inform me what had passed.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, the 22d.</em> Messrs Oswald and Whiteford
came and breakfasted with me. Mr Oswald had received
no letters or instructions. I told him I would write to
Lord Shelburne respecting him, and call on him on Monday
morning to breakfast, and show him what I proposed
to write, that it might receive such alterations as he should
judge proper.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, the 23d.</em> In the afternoon Mr Jay arrived, to
my great satisfaction. I proposed going with him the next
morning to Versailles, and presenting him to M. de Vergennes.
He informed me, that the Spanish Ministers had
been much struck with the news from England, respecting
the resolutions of Parliament to discontinue the war in
America, &amp;c. and that they had since been extremely civil
to him, and he understood intended to send instructions to
their Ambassador at this Court, to make the long talked of
treaty with him here.</p>

<p><em>Monday, the 24th.</em> Wrote a note of excuse to Mr Oswald,
promising to see him on Wednesday, and went with
Mr Jay to Versailles. Count de Vergennes acquainted us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
that he had given to Mr Grenville the answer to his propositions,
who had immediately despatched it to his Court.
He read it to us, and I shall endeavor to obtain a copy of
it. Count de Vergennes informing us, that a frigate was
about to be despatched for America, by which we might
write, and that the courier who was to carry down the
despatches would set out on Wednesday morning, we
concluded to omit coming to Court on Tuesday, in order
to prepare our letters. Count de Vergennes appeared to
have some doubts about the sincerity of the British Court,
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon foi</i> of Mr Grenville, but said the return of
Mr Grenville's courier might give light. I wrote the
following letters to Mr Secretary Livingston, and Mr
Morris.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><em>Wednesday, the 26th.</em> I sent away my letters, and
went to see Mr Oswald. I showed him the draft of a
letter to be addressed to him instead of Lord Shelburne,
respecting the commission, or public character he might
hereafter be vested with; this draft was founded on Lord
Shelburne's memorandums, which Mr Oswald had shown
to me, and this letter was intended to be communicated by
him to Lord Shelburne. Mr Oswald liked the mode, but
rather chose that no mention should be made of his having
shown me Lord Shelburne's memorandums, though he
thought they were given to him for that purpose. So I
struck that part out, and new modelled the letter, which I
sent him the next day, as follows.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, June 27th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">"Sir,
</p>

<p>"The opinion I have of your candor, probity, and good
understanding, and good will to both countries, made me
hope you would have been vested with the character of
Plenipotentiary to treat with those from America. When
Mr Grenville produced his first commission, which was
only to treat with France, I did imagine that the other to
treat with us was reserved for you, and kept only till the
Enabling Bill should be passed. Mr Grenville has since
received a second commission, which, as he informs me,
has additional words, empowering him to treat with the
Ministers of any other <em>Prince</em> or <em>State</em> whom it may
concern, and he seems to understand that those general
words comprehend the United States of America. There
may be no doubt that they may comprehend Spain and
Holland, but as there exist various public acts, by which
the government of Britain denies us to be States, and none
in which they acknowledge us to be such, it seems hardly
clear that we could be intended at the time the commission
was given, the <em>Enabling Act</em> not being then passed.
So that though I can have no objection to Mr Grenville,
nor right to make it if I had any, yet as your long residence
in America has given you a knowledge of that
country, its people, circumstances, commerce, &amp;c. which,
added to your experience in business, may be useful to
both sides in facilitating and expediting the negotiation, I
cannot but hope that it is still intended to vest you with the
character abovementioned, respecting the treaty with America,
either separately or in conjunction with Mr Grenville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
as to the wisdom of your Ministers may seem best. Be it
as it may, I beg you would accept this line as a testimony
of the sincere esteem and respect with which, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN."
</p>

<p><em>Friday, June 28th.</em> M. de Rayneval called upon me,
and acquainted me that the Ministers had received intelligence
from England, that besides the orders given to
General Carleton to propose terms of reunion to America,
artful emissaries were sent over, to go through the country
and stir up the people to call on the Congress to accept
those terms, they being similar to those settling with Ireland;
that it would, therefore, be well for Mr Jay and me
to write and caution Congress against these practices. He
said Count de Vergennes wished also to know what I had
written respecting the negotiation, as it would be well for
us to hold pretty near the same language. I told him that
I did not apprehend the least danger, that such emissaries
would meet with any success, or that the Congress would
make any treaty with General Carleton. That I would,
however, write as he desired; and Mr Jay coming in,
promised the same. He said the courier would go tomorrow.
I accordingly wrote the following letter to Mr Secretary
Livingston.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>M. de Rayneval, who is Secretary to the Council of
State, called again in the evening. I gave him copies of
the three preceding letters to peruse and show to Count de
Vergennes, to convince him that we held no underhand
dealings here. I own I had, at the same time, another view
in it, which was, that they should see I had been ordered
to demand further aids, and had forborne to make the demands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
with my reasons, hoping that if they could possibly
help us to more money, they might be induced to do it.</p>

<p>I had never made any visit to Count d'Aranda, the
Spanish Ambassador, for reasons before mentioned. M.
de Rayneval told Mr Jay and me this morning, that it
would be well for us to wait on him, and he had authority
to assure us, we should be well received. We
accordingly concluded to wait on his Excellency the next
morning.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, June 29th.</em> We went together to the Spanish
Ambassador's, who received us with great civility and
politeness. He spoke with Mr Jay on the subject of the
treaty they were to make together, and mentioned in
general, as a principle, that the two powers should consider
each other's conveniency, and accommodate and
compensate each other as well as they could. That an
exact compensation might, perhaps, not be possible, but
should be approached as nearly as the nature of things
would admit. Thus, says he, if there is a certain thing
which would be convenient to each of us, but more convenient
to one than to the other, it should be given to the
one to whom it would be most convenient, and compensation
made by giving another thing to the other, for the
same reason. I suppose he had in view something relating
to boundaries or territories, because, he added, we will sit
down together with maps in our hands, and, by that means,
shall see our way more clearly. I learnt from him, that
the expedition against Providence had sailed, but no advice
was yet received of its success. On our going out,
he took pains himself to open the folding doors for us,
which is a high compliment here; and told us he would
return our visit, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendre son devoir</i>) and then fix a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
with us for dining with him. I dined with Mr Jay and a
company of Americans at his lodgings.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, July 1st.</em> Mr Grenville called on me.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<h2>CORRESPONDENCE CONTINUED.</h2>

<h3>TO HENRY LAURENS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 2d, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter you did me the honor of writing to
me from Lyons the 24th past.</p>

<p>I wonder a little at Mr &mdash;&mdash; not acquainting you whether
your name was in the commission or not. I begin to
suspect, from various circumstances, that the British Ministry,
elated perhaps too much by the success of Admiral
Rodney, are not in earnest to treat immediately, but rather
with delay. They seem to hope that further successes
may enable them to treat more advantageously; or, as
some suppose, that certain propositions to be made to Congress
by General Carleton, may render a treaty here with
us unnecessary. A little bad news, which it is possible
they may yet receive from the same quarter, will contribute
to set them right; and then we may enter seriously
upon the treaty; otherwise I conjecture it may not take
place till after another campaign. Mr Jay is arrived here.
Mr Grenville and Mr Oswald continue here. Mr Oswald
has yet received no commission; and that of Mr Grenville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
does not very clearly comprehend us according to British
ideas; therefore it requires explication. When I know
more, you shall have further information.</p>

<p>Not having an immediate answer to what I wrote you,
concerning the absolution of Lord Cornwallis's parole, and
Major Ross coming over hither from him to press it, I
gave him the discharge you desired. Enclosed I send
you a copy. I hear it has proved satisfactory to him; I
hope it will be so to you.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 10th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received your favor of the 26th past by Mr Young,
and am indebted to you for some preceding. I do not
know why the good work of peace goes on so slowly on
your side. Some have imagined that your Ministers,
since Rodney's success, are desirous of trying fortune a
little further before they conclude the war; others, that
they have not a good understanding with each other.
What I have just heard seems to countenance this opinion.
It is said Mr Fox has resigned. We are ready here,
on the part of America, to enter into treaty with you in
concurrence with our allies, and are disposed to be very
reasonable; but if your <em>plenipotentiary</em>, notwithstanding
that character, is upon every proposition obliged to send a
courier and wait an answer, we shall not soon see the happy
conclusion. It has been suspected, too, that you wait
to hear the effect of some overtures, sent by General
Carleton for a separate peace in America. A vessel just
arrived from Maryland brings us the unanimous resolutions
of their Assembly, for continuing the war at all hazards,
rather than violate their faith with France. This is a sample
of the success to be expected from such a measure, if
it has really been taken, which I hardly believe.</p>

<p>There is methinks a point that has been too little considered
in treaties, the means of making them durable. An
honest peasant, from the mountains of Provence, brought
me the other day a manuscript he had written on the subject,
and which he could not procure permission to print.
It appeared to me to have much good sense in it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
therefore I got some copies to be struck off for him to distribute
where he may think fit. I send you one enclosed.
This man aims at no profit from his pamphlet or his project,
asks for nothing, expects nothing, and does not even desire
to be known. He has acquired, he tells me, a fortune of
near one hundred and fifty crowns a year, (about eighteen
pounds sterling) with which he is content. This you may
imagine would not afford the expense of riding to Paris, so
he came on foot; such was his zeal for peace, and the
hope of forwarding and securing it, by communicating his
ideas to great men here. His rustic and poor appearance
has prevented his access to them, or his obtaining their attention;
but he does not seem yet to be discouraged. I
honor much the character of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">véritable philosophe</i>.</p>

<p>I thank you much for your letters of May the 1st, 13th,
and 25th, with your proposed preliminaries. It is a pleasure
to me to find our sentiments so concurring on points of
importance; it makes discussions as unnecessary as they
might between us be inconvenient.</p>

<p>I am, my dear Sir, with great esteem and affection,
yours ever.</p>

<h3>TO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 10th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>By the original law of nations, war and extirpation were
the punishment of injury. Humanizing by degrees, it admitted
slavery instead of death. A further step was, the
exchange of prisoners instead of slavery. Another, to
respect more the property of private persons under conquest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
and to be content with acquired dominion. Why
should not the law of nations go on improving? Ages
have intervened between its several steps, but as knowledge
of late increases rapidly, why should not those steps
be quickened? Why should it not be agreed to as the future
law of nations, that in any war hereafter the following
descriptions of men should be undisturbed, have the protection
of both sides, and be permitted to follow their employments
in surety, viz.</p>

<p>1. Cultivators of the earth, because they labor for the
subsistence of mankind.</p>

<p>2. Fishermen, for the same reason.</p>

<p>3. Merchants and traders, in unarmed ships, who accommodate
different nations by communicating and exchanging
the necessaries and conveniences of life.</p>

<p>4. Artists and mechanics, inhabiting and working in
open towns.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add, that the hospitals of enemies
should not be molested; they ought to be assisted.</p>

<p>In short, I would have nobody fought with, but those
who are paid for fighting. If obliged to take corn from
the farmer, friend or enemy, I would pay him for it; the
same for the fish or goods of the others.</p>

<p>This once established, that encouragement to war, which
arises from a spirit of rapine, would be taken away, and
peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting.</p>

<h3>TO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 11th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>In mine of yesterday, which went by Mr Young, I made
no mention of yours of May 11th, it not being before me.
I have just found it.</p>

<p>You speak of a "proposed dependent State of America,
which you thought Mr Oswald would begin with." As
yet I have heard nothing of it. I have all along understood
(perhaps I have understood more than was intended)
that the point of dependence was given up, and that we
are to be treated with as a free people. I am not sure
that Mr Oswald has explicitly said so, but I know that Mr
Grenville has, and that he was to make that declaration
previous to the commencement of the treaty. It is now
intimated to me from several quarters, that Lord Shelburne's
plan is to retain the sovereignty for the King, giving
us otherwise an independent Parliament, and a government
similar to that of late intended for Ireland. If this
be really his project, our negotiation for peace will not go
very far. The thing is impracticable and impossible, being
inconsistent with the faith we have pledged, to say
nothing of the general disposition of our people. Upon
the whole I should believe, that though Lord Shelburne
might formerly have entertained such an idea, he had probably
dropped it before he sent Mr Oswald here; your
words above cited do however throw a little doubt in my
mind, and have, with the intimations of others, made me
less free in communication with his Lordship, whom I
much esteem and honor, than I should otherwise have
been. I wish, therefore, you would afford me what you
can of eclairoissement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>This letter going by a courier, will probably get to hand
long before the one preceding in date, which went by Mr
Young, who travels on foot. I therefore enclose the copy
of it, which was taken in the press. You may return it to
me when the other arrives.</p>

<p>By the return of the courier, you may oblige me, by
communicating what is fairly communicable, of the history
of Mr Fox's and Lord J. Cavendish's resignation, with
any other changes made or likely to be made.</p>

<p>With sincere esteem, I am ever, my dear friend, yours
most affectionately,</p>

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I enclose a letter for Lord Shelburne, to go by your
courier, with some others, of which I request his care.
They may be put into the penny post. I have received a
note informing me, that "some opposition given by his
Lordship to Mr Fox's decided <em>plan of unequivocally acknowledging
American independence</em>, was one cause of
that gentleman's resignation;" this, from what you have
told me, appears improbable. It is further said, "that Mr
Grenville thinks Mr Fox's resignation will be fatal to the
present negotiation." This perhaps is as groundless as the
former. Mr Grenville's next courier will probably clear
up matters. I did understand from him, that such an acknowledgment
was intended previous to the commencement
of the treaty; until it is made, and the treaty formally
begun, propositions and discussions seem in consideration
to be untimely; nor can I enter into particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
without Mr Jay, who is now ill with the influenza. My
letter, therefore, to his Lordship is merely complimentary
on his late appointment. I wish a continuance of
your health, in that at present sickly city, being with sincere
esteem, Sir, your most obedient and most humble
servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> I send you enclosed the late resolutions of the
State of Maryland, by which the general disposition of people
in America may be guessed, respecting any treaty to
be proposed by General Carleton, if intended, which I
do not believe.</p>

<p>Mr Oswald informing me, that he is about to despatch
a courier, I embrace the opportunity of congratulating your
Lordship on your appointment to the treasury. It is an
extension of your power to do good, and in that view, if
in no other, it must increase your happiness, which I
heartily wish.</p>

<h3>TO M. DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 24th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>In answer to your questions, Mr Oswald is doing nothing,
having neither powers nor instructions; and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
tired of doing nothing, has despatched a courier requesting
leave to return. He has, I believe, received no letters,
since I saw you, from Lord Shelburne. Mr Grenville's
return hither is, I think, doubtful, as he was particularly
connected in friendship with Mr Fox, but if he stays, I
suppose some other will be sent, for I do not yet see sufficient
reason to think they would abandon the negotiation,
though, from some appearances, I imagine they are more
intent upon dividing us, than upon making a general peace.
I have heard nothing further from Mr Laurens, nor received
any paper from him respecting Lord Cornwallis.
And since that General's letter, written after the battle of
Camden, and ordering not only the confiscation of rebels'
estates, but the hanging of prisoners, has been made public,
I should not wonder if the Congress were to disallow our
absolution of his parole, and recall him to America.</p>

<p>With everlasting esteem and respect, I am, dear Sir,
yours most affectionately,</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, July 26th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>You will have heard before you receive this, that Mr
Thomas Townshend is appointed Secretary of State for
that department to which the American correspondence
belongs. He is, and has been for many years, one of my
most intimate friends. A more honorable and honest
man does not exist. I have been requested, in connexion
with him, to undertake one branch of his office relating to
America, as instrumental to some necessary arrangements
in the course of a negotiation for peace with America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
The point which I have been requested to undertake is
the case, or rather the diversity of cases, of the American
refugees. I understand, that in the progress of this business,
I shall be referred to a correspondence with you, as
matter may arise. My purpose, therefore, for the present,
is only to advertise you of this, in case you should have
any preliminary matter to give or receive elucidation upon.
I am very ready to undertake any matter, which may be
necessary or instrumental towards peace, especially in connexion
with my worthy friend Mr Townshend.</p>

<p>You know all my principles upon American pacification,
and <em>sweet reconciliation</em>. I shall always remain in the
same. But the delegation of a single point to me, such
as the case of the refugees, does not entitle me to advise
upon the great outlines or principles of such pacific negotiations.
I shall retain my full reservation in such points
as events may justify. My personal motive for saying
this to you is obvious. But, in point of justice to those
who have at present the direction of public measures in
this country, I must request that this caution of mine may
be accepted only as personal to myself, and not as inferential
upon the conduct of others, where I am not a
party. Having taken a zealous part in the principles and
negotiations of peace, I wish to stand clear from any
collateral constructions, which might affect myself, and at
the same time not to impose any collateral or inferential
constructions upon others.</p>

<p>God prosper the work of peace and <em>good will</em> (as the
means of peace) among men.</p>

I am ever your affectionate friend,</p>

Whitehall, July 26th, 1782.
</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>As the first object of my wishes is to contribute to the
establishment of an honorable and lasting peace, I address
myself to you without ceremony, upon the conviction that
you agree with me in this principle. If I was not convinced
that it was also the real system of the Ministers of
this country, I should not now be co-operating with them.
The step they had already taken, in sending Mr Grenville
to Paris, is a proof of their intentions, and as that gentleman
does not return to his station there, I trust that the
immediate appointment of a person to succeed him, will
testify my agreement to the principles upon which he was
employed. I therefore beg leave to recommend Mr Fitzherbert
to your acquaintance, who has the King's commands
to repair to Paris.</p>

<p>As I have not the advantage of being known to you, I
can claim no pretence for my application to you, but my
public situation, and my desire to merit your confidence
upon a subject of so much importance, as a pacification
between the parties engaged in a calamitous war.</p>

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, July 28th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have but this moment had an opportunity, by the departure
of my company, of perusing the letters you put
into my hands this afternoon, and I return them directly
without waiting till our interview tomorrow morning, because
I would not give a moment's delay to the delivery
of those directed to other persons.</p>

<p>The situation of Captain Asgill and his family afflicts
me, but I do not see what can be done by any one here to
relieve them. It cannot be supposed, that General Washington
has the least desire of taking the life of that gentleman.
His aim is to obtain the punishment of a deliberate
murder, committed on a prisoner in cold blood, by
Captain Lippincott. If the English refuse to deliver up
or punish this murderer, it is saying, that they choose to
preserve him rather than Captain Asgill. It seems to me,
therefore, that the application should be made to the
English Ministers for positive orders, directing General
Carleton to deliver up Lippincott, which orders being obtained,
should be despatched immediately by a swift sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
vessel. I do not think any other means can produce
the effect desired. The cruel murders of this kind, committed
by the English on our people, since the commencement
of the war, are innumerable. The Congress and
their Generals, to satisfy the people, have often threatened
retaliation, but have always hitherto forborne to execute it;
and they have been often insultingly told by their enemies,
that this forbearance did not proceed from humanity, but
fear. General Greene, though he solemnly and publicly
promised it in a proclamation, never made any retaliation
for the murder of Colonel Haynes, and many others in
Carolina, and the people, who now think if he had fulfilled
his promise this crime would not have been committed,
clamor so loudly, that I doubt General Washington cannot
well refuse what appears to them so just and necessary for
their common security. I am persuaded that nothing I
could say to him on the occasion would have the least
effect in changing his determination.</p>

<p>Excuse me, then, if I presume to advise the despatching
a courier immediately to London, proposing to the
consideration of Ministers the sending such orders to General
Carleton directly. They would have an excellent
effect in other views. The post goes tomorrow morning
at ten o'clock, but as nine days have been spent in bringing
the letters here by that conveyance, an express is preferable.</p>

<p>With sincere esteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
Philadelphia, August 9th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Having written to Mr Jay, who I presume is with you,
I do not think it necessary to repeat what I have mentioned
to him. We have not heard from you since
March; a very long period, considering the interesting
events that have taken place between that time and this.
Many vessels have arrived without bringing us a line from
you. I am apprehensive that Mr Barclay does not communicate
to you the frequent opportunities that offer of
writing. I shall write to him upon the subject.</p>

<p>Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby have informed
the General, that a negotiation for a general peace is now
on foot, and that the King, his master, has agreed to yield
the independence of America without making it conditional.
I shall enclose a copy of his letter at large, which
refers to another object; the exchange of prisoners. This
great point once yielded, I see nothing that will obstruct
your negotiations, except three points of discussion, which
I have before written to you about. I wish it had been
possible to obtain the estimates I mention, as they might
have been rendered useful to you upon one of them. But
the negligence of the Governors, or Legislatures of the
several States, have rendered all my endeavors hitherto
unsuccessful, notwithstanding repeated promises to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
this subject their earliest attention. The restoration of confiscated
property has become utterly impossible, and the
attempt would throw the country into the utmost confusion.</p>

<p>The fisheries are too important an object for you to lose
sight of, and as to the back lands, I do not conceive that
England can seriously expect to derive any benefit from
them, that will be equivalent to the jealousy that the possession
of them would awaken and keep alive between her
and this country. I transmit to you a bill for seventyone
thousand three hundred and eighty livres, being the amount
of one quarter's salary to yourself, and Messrs Jay, Adams,
Carmichael, Dana, and Dumas. No provision is made
for the private Secretaries or contingencies, not having
been furnished with an account of them. I also send bills
for the first quarter, commencing in January, so that you
will, on the receipt of this, be enabled to pay one half
year's salary to our Ministers and their Secretaries.</p>

<p>I just now learn, that Carleton has published his and
Digby's letter to the General. The design of this
must either be, to see whether the people of this country
will catch so eagerly at the proposition for a peace, which
yields them their independence, as to be careless about
the alliance, or to impress us with an idea, that we are
more indebted for our freedom to the generosity of Great
Britain, than to tha attention of France to our interests in
the general treaty. It is not to be doubted, that the good
sense and the gratitude of this country will defeat both
these objects.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, August 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have lately been honored with your several letters,
No. 10, March 9th; No. 11, May 22d; and No. 12,
May 30th.</p>

<p>The paper, containing a state of the commerce in North
America, and explaining the necessity and utility of convoys
for its protection, I have laid before the Minister, accompanied
by a letter, pressing that it be taken into immediate
consideration; and I hope it may be attended with
success.</p>

<p>The order of Congress, for liquidating the accounts between
this Court and the United States, was executed
before it arrived. All the accounts against us for money
lent, and stores, arms, ammunition, clothing, &amp;c. furnished
by government, were brought in and examined, and
a balance received, which made the debt amount to the
even sum of eighteen millions, exclusive of the Holland
loan, for which the King is guarantee. I send a copy of
the instrument to Mr Morris. In reading it, you will discover
several fresh marks of the King's goodness towards
us, amounting to the value of near two millions. These,
added to the free gifts before made to us at different times,
form an object of at least twelve millions, for which no returns
but that of gratitude and friendship are expected.
These, I hope, may be everlasting. The constant good
understanding between France and the Swiss Cantons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
and the steady benevolence of this Crown towards them,
afford us a well grounded hope that our alliance may be as
durable and as happy for both nations; there being strong
reasons for our union, and no crossing interests between
us. I write fully to Mr Morris on money affairs, who will
doubtless communicate to you my letter, so that I need
say the less to you on that subject.</p>

<p>The letter to the King was well received; the accounts
of your rejoicings on the news of the dauphin's birth give
pleasure here; as do the firm conduct of Congress, in refusing
to treat with General Carleton, and the unanimous
resolutions of the assemblies of different States on the
same subject. All ranks of this nation appear to be in good
humor with us, and our reputation rises throughout Europe.
I understand from the Swedish Ambassador, that
their treaty with us will go on as soon as ours with Holland
is finished; our treaty with France, with such improvements
as that with Holland may suggest, being intended as
the basis.</p>

<p>There have been various misunderstandings and mismanagements
among the parties concerned in the expedition
of the Bon Homme Richard, which have occasioned
delay in dividing the prize money. M. de Chaumont,
who was chosen by the captains of all the vessels in the
expedition as their agent, has long been in a state little
short of bankruptcy, and some of the delays have possibly
been occasioned by the distress of his affairs. He
now informs me, that the money is in the hands of the
Minister of the Marine. I shall in a few days present
the Memorial you propose, with one relating to the prisoners,
and will acquaint you with the answer. Mr Barclay
is still in Holland; when he returns he may take into his
hands what money can be obtained on that account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>I think your observations respecting the Danish complaints
through the Minister of France perfectly just. I
will receive no more of them by that channel, and will give
your reasons to justify my refusal.</p>

<p>Your approbation of my idea of a medal to perpetuate
the memory of York and Saratoga victories gives me great
pleasure, and encourages me to have it struck. I wish
you would acquaint me with what kind of a monument at
York the emblems required are to be fixed on; whether
an obelisk or a column; its dimensions; whether any
part of it is to be marble, and the emblems carved on it,
and whether the work is to be executed by the excellent
artists in that way which Paris affords; and if so, to what
expense they are to be limited. This puts me in mind of
a monument I got made here and sent to America, by
order of Congress, five years since. I have heard of its
arrival, and nothing more. It was admired here for its
elegant antique simplicity of design, and the various beautiful
marbles used in its composition. It was intended to
be fixed against a wall in the State House of Philadelphia.
I know not why it has been so long neglected; it
would, methinks, be well to inquire after it, and get it put
up somewhere. Directions for fixing it were sent with it.
I enclose a print of it. The inscription in the engraving is
not on the monument; it was merely the fancy of the engraver.
There is a while plate of marble left smooth to
receive such inscription as the Congress should think
proper.</p>

<p>Our countrymen, who have been prisoners in England,
are sent home, a few excepted, who were sick, and who
will be forwarded as soon as recovered. This eases us of
a very considerable charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>I communicated to the Marquis de Lafayette the paragraph
of your letter which related to him. He is still
here, and as there seems not much likelihood of an active
campaign in America, he is probably more useful where
he is. His departure, however, though delayed, is not
absolutely laid aside.</p>

<p>The second changes in the Ministry of England have
occasioned, or have afforded, pretences for various delays
in the negotiation for peace. Mr Grenville had two successive
imperfect commissions. He was at length recalled,
and Mr Fitzherbert is now arrived to replace him,
with a commission in due form to treat with France,
Spain, and Holland. Mr Oswald, who is here, is informed
by a letter from the new Secretary of State, that a
commission, empowering him to treat with the Commissioners
of Congress, will pass the seals, and be sent him in
a few days; till he arrives, this Court will not proceed
in its own negotiation. I send the <em>Enabling Act</em>, as it is
called. Mr Jay will acquaint you with what passes between
him and the Spanish Ambassador, respecting the
proposed treaty with Spain. I will only mention, that my
conjecture of that Court's design to coop us up within the
Allegany mountains is now manifested. I hope Congress
will insist on the Mississippi as the boundary, and
the free navigation of the river from which they could
entirely exclude us.</p>

<p>An account of a terrible massacre of the Moravian Indians
has been put into my hands. I sent you the papers,
that you may see how the fact is represented in Europe.

<h3>TO ROBERT MORRIS.</h3>

<p class="head">
Passy, August 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received (many of them at the same time) your
sundry letters of March the 23d, April 8th and 17th, May
17th, 18th, two of the 23d and 29th. It would be a satisfaction
to me, if you would likewise mention from time to
time the dates of those you receive from me.</p>

<p>Most of your letters press my obtaining more money
for the present year. The late losses suffered in the West
Indies, and the unforeseen necessary expenses the reparation
there and here must occasion, render it more difficult,
and I am told, impossible; though the good disposition
of the Court towards us continues perfect. All I can say
on the head of money, more than I have said in preceding
letters is, that I confide you will be careful not to bankrupt
your banker by your drafts; and I will do my utmost that
those you draw shall be duly honored.</p>

<p>The plan you intimate for discharging the bills in favor
of Beaumarchais, though well imagined, was impracticable.
I had accepted them, and he had discounted them, or
paid them away, or divided them amongst his creditors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
They were, therefore, in different hands, with whom I
could not manage the transactions proposed. Besides, I
had paid them punctually when they became due, which
was before the receipt of your letter on that subject.
That he was furnished with his funds by the government
here, is a supposition of which no foundation appears; he
says it was by a company he had formed; and when he
solicited me to give up a cargo in part of payment, he
urged, with tears in his eyes, the distress himself and associates
were reduced to, by our delay of remittances.
I am glad to see that it is intended to appoint a Commissioner
to settle all our public accounts in Europe. I
hope he will have better success with M. Beaumarchais
than I have had. He has often promised solemnly to
render an account in two or three days. Years have
since elapsed, and he has not yet done it. Indeed, I
doubt whether his books have been so well kept as to
make it possible.</p>

<p>You direct me, in yours of May 17th, to pay over into
the hands of Mr Grand, on your account, such monies belonging
to the United States as may be in Europe, distinct
from those to be advanced for the current year. I would
do it with pleasure if there were any such. There may be,
indeed, some in Holland, raised by the new loan, but that
is not in my disposition, though I have no doubt that Mr
Adams will, on occasion, apply it in support of your credit.
As to all the aids given by the crown, all the sums borrowed
of it, and all the Dutch loans of ten millions, though
the orders to receive have been given to me, the payments
from the <em>Tresor Royal</em> have all been made on my orders
in favor of Mr Grand, and the money again paid away by
him on my drafts for public services and expenses, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
will see by his accounts; so that I never saw or touched a
livre of it, except what I received from him in discharge of
my salary, and some disbursements. He has even received
the whole six millions of the current year, so that I
have nothing in any shape to pay over to him. On occasion
of my lately desiring to know the state of our funds,
that I might judge whether I could undertake to pay what
you were directed to pay to Mr William Lee, by vote of
Congress, as soon as the state of public finances would
admit, Mr Grand wrote me a note, with a short sketch
of their then supposed situation, which I enclose. You
will probably have from him, as soon as possible, a more
perfect account; but this will serve to show, that I could
not prudently comply with your wish, of making that payment
to Mr Lee, and I have accordingly declined it; the
less unwillingly as he is entitled by the vote to interest.</p>

<p>I send herewith the accounts of the supplies we have
received in goods, which I promised in my last.</p>

<p>The sum of their value is included in the settlement
made with this Court, mentioned in a former letter.
Herewith I also send a copy of the contract, which has
been long in hand, and but lately completed. The term
of the first yearly payment we are to make was readily
changed at my request, from the first to the third year
after the peace; the other marks of the King's bounty
towards us will be seen in the instrument. The interest
already due and forgiven amounts to more than a million
and a half. What might become due before the peace is
uncertain. The charges of exchange, commissions, brokerage,
&amp;c. of the Dutch loan, amount to more than five
hundred thousand livres, which is also given, so that we
have the whole sum net, and are to pay for it but four per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
cent. This liquidation of our accounts with the Court
was completed before the vote of Congress directing it
came to hand. Mr Grand examined all the particulars,
and I have no doubt of its being approved.</p>

<p>Mr Grand, to whom I have communicated your letter
of April 17th, will soon write to you fully. We shall observe
the general rule you give respecting the 5th, 6th,
7th, and 8th bills. The attention, care, and pains necessary
to prevent, (by exact accounts of those accepted, and
an examination of those offered,) impositions which are
often attempted by presenting at a distant time, the 2d, 3d,
&amp;c. are much greater than I could have imagined. Much
has been saved by that attention, of which of late we keep
an account; but the hazard of loss by such attempts might
be diminished, together with the trouble of examination,
by making fewer small bills.</p>

<p>Your conduct, activity, and address as a financier and
provider for the exigencies of the State, are much admired
and praised here, their good consequences being so evident,
particularly with regard to the rising credit of our country
and the value of bills. No one but yourself can enjoy
your growing reputation more than I do.</p>

<p>Mr Grand has undertaken to pay any balance, that may
be found due to Messrs le Couteulx out of the money in
his hands. Applying for so small a sum as 5000 livres
would be giving trouble for a trifle, as all applications for
money must be considered in Council.</p>

<p>Mr Grand having already received the whole six millions,
either in money or accepted bills, payable at different
periods, I expect he will deliver up to me the bills for that
sum, which you have drawn upon me, the rather as they
express value received by you. I never heard of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
mention here of intended monthly payments, or that the
money could not be obtained but by your drafts. I enclose
a letter, by which the payment was ordered of the
last three millions.</p>

<p>I observe what you mention of the order, that the Ministers'
salaries are to be hereafter paid in America. I
hereby empower and desire you to receive and remit
mine. I do not doubt your doing it regularly and timely;
for a Minister without money, I perceive, makes a ridiculous
figure here, though secure from arrests. I have taken
a quarter's advance of salary from the 4th of last month,
supposing it not intended to <em>muzzle</em> immediately <em>the mouth
of the ox that treadeth out the corn</em>.</p>

<p class="close">
With great esteem, I am, &amp;c.</p>

Barclay still in Holland.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="head">
London, August 16th, 1782.</p>

<p class="open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>Yours I received by Major Young, together with the
work of your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">véritable philosophe</i>, which is full of humanity.
I was not before that at a loss where I should have
looked for my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">véritable philosophe</i>, in the present actual
scene of public politics. Your honest, anxious, and unremitted
endeavors towards the re-establishment of peace,
must endear you to your own country, and to all mankind.
Whatever may have been transacted in America, (if it
can be possible, that the suspicions which you mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
should become true, viz. to tamper with America for a
breach of faith, of which some suspicions seem to be
thrown out by the Provinces of Maryland and Philadelphia,)
I can give the strongest testimonies of the constant
honor and good faith of your conduct and correspondencies;
and my letters to you will bear me equal testimony,
that I have never thrown out any dishonorable suggestions
to you. When the proposed Congress of your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">véritable
philosophe</i> shall meet, neither of us need fear its censures,
upon the strictest examination of our correspondence.
We will claim the poet's character of the sincere statesman,</p>

<p class="center">
"Who knew no thought, but what the world might hear."
</p>

<p>In times of suspicion, it must be some satisfaction to both
of us to know, that no line or word has ever passed between
us, but what the governments of Great Britain,
France, and America, might freely peruse as the words of
good faith, peace, and <em>sweet reconciliation</em>.</p>

<p>The resolutions of Maryland and Philadelphia, together
with the slow proceedings of our <em>plenipotentiaries</em>, and
even the doubt suggested, whether they may not be waiting
for events in America, give me much concern. Not
being informed to a certainty of the state of the negotiation,
I have declined any concern with the Ministry upon
the subject of the refugees, &amp;c. My assistance cannot be
indispensable upon that topic, but I deem it indispensable
to myself not to be committed in unknown ground, which,
from the points abovementioned, must appear dubious to
me. These are the reasons which I gave to the Minister
for declining. I must, at the same time, give him the justice
of the most absolute and unlimited professions of sincerity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
for peace. Whatever divisions there may have
been, as you say, suspected in the Cabinet, there are some
of his colleagues still remaining, in whom I have the greatest
confidence for sincerity and good intentions. The
public prints of this country have stated what are called
<em>shades</em> of difference as to the mode. Those opinions,
which are imputed to Mr Fox, are certainly most suitable
to my opinions. I am free to confess to you, that my
wishes would have been to have taken the most decisive
ground relating to independence, &amp;c. immediately from the
27th of March last, viz. the accession of the change of
Ministry. But I agree with you in sentiment, viz. to concur
with all the good that offers, when we cannot obtain all
the good that we might wish. The situation of my sentiments
at present is, an unbiassed neutrality of expectation,
as events may justify.</p>

<p>I shall be obliged to you for the earliest communications
of any public events in America, that may come to Europe
with any public resolutions of Congress or the Provinces,
&amp;c., and all memorials or negotiations, which may pass between
the parties in America. I am very anxious to have
the earliest information to form my opinions upon, and to be
prepared accordingly. My utmost endeavors will always
be exerted to the blessed work of peace.</p>

<p class="close">I am ever, your affectionate</p>

<p class="signature">
D. HARTLEY.

I send you adjoined the certificate you desire, and am perfectly convinced,

body was authorised to hold the language, which has been imputed to
him on that subject, and as I have a high opinion of his candor and

</p>
<p>
I do hereby certify whom it may concern, that I was with Mr Pultney
and Dr Franklin at Paris, when in a conversation between them,
on the subject of certain propositions for a reconciliation with America,
offered by Mr Pultney, Dr Franklin said, he did not approve of them,
nor did he think they would be approved in America, but that he would
communicate them to his colleagues and the French ministry. This
Mr Pultney opposed, saying that it would answer no good end, as he
was persuaded, that what weighed with Dr Franklin would weigh also
with them, and therefore desired, that no mention might be made of
his having offered such propositions, or even of his having been here
on such business, but that the whole might be buried in oblivion, agreeable
to what had been stipulated by Mr Pultney, and agreed to by Dr
Franklin, before the propositions were produced, which Dr Franklin
accordingly promised.

</p>
<blockquote><p class="hanging2">A Bill to invest the Crown with sufficient Powers to treat, consult, and
finally to agree upon the Means of restoring Peace with the Provinces
of North America.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Whereas many unfortunate subjects of contest have of late years
subsisted between Great Britain and the several Provinces of North
America, hereinafter recited, viz. New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the
three lower counties on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia, which have brought on the calamities
of war between Great Britain and the aforesaid provinces, to the
end therefore that the further effusion of blood may be prevented, and
that peace may be restored, may it please your Majesty that it be enacted,
and be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and
Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority
of the same, that it shall and may be lawful for his Majesty, by letters
patent, under the great seal of Great Britain, to authorise and empower
any person or persons, to treat, consult, and finally to agree with any
person or persons properly authorised on the part of the aforesaid
provinces of North America, upon the means of restoring peace between
Great Britain and the aforesaid provinces, according to the powers
in this act contained.
</p><p>
And be it further enacted, that in order to facilitate the good purposes
of this act, his Majesty may lawfully enable any such person or
persons, so appointed by his Majesty's letters patent, as aforesaid, to
order and proclaim a cessation of hostilities, on the part of his Majesty's
forces, by sea and land, for any time, and under any conditions
or restrictions.
</p><p>
And be it further enacted, that in order to lay a good foundation for
a cordial reconciliation and lasting peace between Great Britain and
the aforesaid provinces of North America, by restoring an amicable intercourse
between the same as soon as possible his Majesty may lawfully
enable any such person or persons, so appointed by his Majesty's
letters patent, as aforesaid, to enter into and to ratify from time to
time, any article or articles of intercourse and pacification, which article
or articles, so entered into and ratified from time to time, shall remain
in full force and effect for the certain term of ten years, from
the first day of August, one thousand seven hundred and eighty.

Provided also, and be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid,
that in order to remove any obstructions, which may arise to the full
and effectual execution of any article or articles of intercourse and
pacification, as before mentioned, that it shall and may be lawful for
his Majesty, by any instrument under his sign manual, countersigned
by one or more of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, to authorise
and empower any such person or persons, so appointed by his
Majesty's letters patent, as aforesaid, to suspend for the term of ten
years from the first day of August, one thousand seven hundred and
eighty, the operation and effect of any act or acts of Parliament, which
are now in force, respecting the aforesaid provinces of North America,
or any clause or clauses, proviso or provisos, in any such act or acts
of Parliament contained; inasmuch as they, or any of them, may obstruct
the full effect and execution of any such article or articles of intercourse
and pacification, which may be entered into and ratified as
beforementioned, between Great Britain and the aforesaid provinces of
North America.

entered into and ratified, for the certain term of ten years, as beforementioned,
shall from time to time be laid before the two Houses of
Parliament, for their consideration, as the perpetual basis of reconcilement
